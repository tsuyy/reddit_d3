1,"WEEKLY STICKY: 6-13 December 2020 - vaccines, studies asking for participants, and general stuff This week, as you'll all have noticed, there is lots of good news about the vaccines and their imminent roll-outs:

[

[

[

On the downside, along with the vaccine news, oute the anti-vaxxers - there has been a noticeable uptick in posts over the last week that seem suspiciously like attempts to undermine vaccine confidence. Hopefully we've removed most of them before most others see them, but this is a reminder to please REPORT any anti-vaccination sentiment you see on this sub so that we can correct it, and remove it if we think it's malicious. This subreddit has zero tolerance for vaccine 'concerns', 'health freedom' or any vaccine 'WhatAboutism'. We'll also be handing out more 'helpful contributor' flairs to anyone who counters vaccine misinformation before we get to it. 

As you may recall, we ran an AMA with vaccine trial volunteers a few weeks ago, which you can find here: **Vaccine trials AMA**

[ (this AMA is now closed for further questions)

Because we have this AMA, we will not be allowing posts from people claiming to be early recipients of the vaccine roll-out, describing their experiences, as we have no way of verifying their identity and claims. The safety trials have been thorough and extensive. It is extremely unlikely any side-effects that did note to light during these trials will emerge during the roll-outs; therefore any that are reported from the roll-outs will be assumed to be false until a major story is reported in Reuters and/or the BBC. Please help us to keep this sub factual and high-quality. 

**STUDIES LOOKING FOR PARTICIPANTS:**

1. **Study on how people cope with social distancing from** [u/Positive-Karma-3520](

Hi! My colleague and I are researchers trying to understand how people cope with social distancing during COVID - ideally so we can provide more effective ways of helping people feel better. If you have a few minutes, please take this super short survey. We are not collecting any identifying information, just interested in how people cope when missing someone. Thanks so much for your input :)[

2. **Study on information behaviours, risk perceptions and health disparities** from [u/annietchen](

I am an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine, and my collaborators and I are conducting a study relating to COVID-19. It is a survey about information behaviors, risk perceptions, and health disparities relating to COVID-19, and should take approximately 20 minutes. 

The study URL is here:

Still, I am not dealing  with this whole mess very well and it's getting worse and worse as time goes on.  My mental state is deteriorating.  I'm stuck at home, can't do the things I want to do or go the places I want to go.  I feel like I've already lost a year of my life, with still no end in sight.  I've gotten to the point where I even hate to mention it because I then have it thrown at me how ""others have it worse"" and being told how I should, or shouldn't feel.  I feel the way I feel, and others having it worse certainly doesn't make my situation better.  All I want is for my feeling to simply be acknowledged, without judgment.

That I'm just dealing with the same thing everyone else is but other people have it worse on top of Covid. Or some people have had their lives affected by Covid so much worse than me (a family member dying, losing their job, etc). I do feel sorry and bad for all of you who have had it worse than me.

I just can't stop feeling down even with having people in my life and a job that's hanging by a thread. Everyday I just want to cry because we are still in this pandemic. My family has been doing their own things as of lately between my siblings doing school from home and then they game or socialize with their friends online. My folks take care of everything else and I do keep my distance cause I'm nervous of spreading it to them. I do get to see the gf some nights off work but they have her working night shifts a lot which sucks.

I just feel alone even with having a family and a girlfriend. I know I shouldn't be feeling that way but lately there's been several nights where I'm just in my room alone.

7,"Girlfriend and I disagree about COVID safety Hello there! My girlfriend and I both live with our parents. We disagree about how to handle COVID safety. 

I have asthma, anxiety, and like most people, very much do not want to contract COVID. My parents also have underlying health conditions (however, they go to work, so I suppose they take some risks, but I do not want to add to it). During the pandemic, I have been only going to my girlfriend's house and to the grocery store if necessary (wearing a mask).

My girlfriend has been going out, seeing her friends without masks and without social distancing. Cases in my state are going up every day, and obviously COVID is worse now in the U.S. than it was in March when everyone took it seriously. She says the only way she will stop ""living her life"" is if the government forces her to stay home. She refuses to limit the amount of times she sees her friends, and won't even wear a mask around her friends. I think this is extremely inconsiderate to all of the people around her, especially me since I am asking her to take precautions whereas other people in her life don't really care about COVID. I aming to the point where I want to see her, but I refuse to take that risk when she can't do the simplest things to protect herself and me. She guilts me andplains she doesn't get to see me, but the ball is clearly in her court, as she could just take more precautions and I would feel more safe going to see her.

We keep getting into arguments and disagreements about this, and she always has to mention that she doesn't want to sit in her room all day like I do (implying that i'm scared and overreacting about the situation), and she is going to keep living her life as she has been since she hasn't gotten COVID thus far. It has gotten to the point in our arguments where she says if I don't want to see her because I'm afraid of taking risks, then that's my decision (basically saying there's nothing she can do about it). To me, it seems like going to see her friends mask-less several times a week is more important than seeing me/keeping me and everyone else around her safe.

It is deeply upsetting to me to think that my girlfriend doesn't care about my safety, or can't do these simple things like wearing a mask and social distancing to keep us safe. Are my feelings valid here?

I don’t go out. When I go out I wear a mask. I sanitize everything thates into my house and when I’m out walking I go out of my way to avoid even walking through the same area someone else walked in. My area, along with the United States, has uncontrolled spread. 

Last night I went to the grocery store for something small, thinking it was late enough that I could avoid crowds. I wore two cloth masks and a disposable KN95 over those, but there was still air leaking out the sides and bottom. Everyone was wearing some sort of face covering, but I rounded a corner and boom, someone had no mask. I quickly turned and walked the other way, but there were still so many people with just scarves over their faces. at the checkout line people were less than six feet away, and I had to stand in the same air that the maskless person did.

10,"My ex Girlfriend refuses to wear a mask to see me (please offer some advice) My ex girlfriend just moved back into the state & wants to rekindle things. Last summer, we had a pretty bad blowout which resulted in us going our separate ways, i moved to a different town and she moved to a different state for a little while with her sister and we ceased contact for almost a year. a few days ago she reached out with attempts to rekindle things i of course am extremely all in, happy and excited. I had a pretty serious relationship with her and she is honestly the love of my life and i know she feels the same way about me. Like all of us, it's been a terrible year for me. i had 3 deaths in the family (unrelated to covid) and her turning up has made everything feel not so shitty.

We Facetime every morning and things are going so smoothly i've never been happier.

There is nothing that cane between us or ruin it.

except, of course this pandemic.

i have a pre existing condition that if not kill, would 100% most definitely put me in the hospital for Covidplications. My life would be on a string, The people who have my pre existing condition are among the top to die of covidplications and survival rate among us is very low, even with survival my life could be permanently impacted by the aftermath.

i am only 23, i live with 4 other people who while do not have any other pre existing health conditions are at some ""high risk"" due to age.

In March, i left my job and was able to start working from home.

Throughout this time i only go out for grocery essentials and walk my dog late at night when there is no one around.

I have not seen any of my friends, extended family or done any other activities other than gorcery shopping and even then i go extremely early, don't associate with anyone and go in and out.

My aunts, and grandparents who i live with are also very cautious and only go out for grocery essentials

Only one of my aunts leaves the home for work, and she works in an office setting but she is very precautious with covid, and the office she works in is very strict and precautious with covid measures, social distancing and mask requirements.

My state is one of the worst with Covid infections in the US right now, and my state also has no restrictions. Everyone in my state has pretty much moved on from Covid, everywhere is open and pretty much the only places to take ""measures"" are grocery stores...that ""require"" masks but even if you walk in without, they won't enforce it.

My ex girlfriend and her family do not believe in Covid. They think covid restrictions are ridiculous and that it's not such a big deal. They also 'deny' that people are dying of Covid...despite that hospitals are packed and people are even in the hallway floors with hundreds in my state dying daily.

She goes out to eat, bars, parties, large get togethers, and only wears a mask at her factory job where it is required.

The other morning she made it clear to me that she is not wearing a mask because she does not want to be controlled by stupid restrictions that are ridiculous and unnecessary.

and this hurts. The fact that this person i know loves and cares about me, and very well knows the damage COVID could cause me and how it can potentially kill me and how my family and i have worked extremely hard to protect us against this wants to see me and refuses to wear a mask for me. She says she doesn't really care if she gets it ""if its my time to die then it's my time to die"" she has already suspected to had caught covid 3 times.

I can't believe that for a second i actually considered seeing her and not asking her to wear a mask. I am so desperate....to see her..that for a second i tell myself ""its not a big deal"" then i turn on the news and see hundreds in my state dying and being hospitalized and i retract.

I have technically not asked this person directly to wear a mask for me...and talked to them about it..but being that they are so reluctant about wearing it in general and their POV of it i can guess the response i will recieve.

Should i take a risk, just double up with masks and go meet her in downtown outdoors...or how should i ask her if she can wear a mask? i don't want to lose her because she will feel like im forcing her to do something again but...if she won't do this for me... i don't know.",4,1,k8n3ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k8n3ju/my_ex_girlfriend_refuses_to_wear_a_mask_to_see_me/,4,Discussion,2020-12-08,-16,221,-0.07239819004524888

12,"The pandemic turned me into the one thing I never wanted to be: a lonely, unaplished loser. Even with the vaccine news, I’m hurting so much.

It was all downhill from March for me. Losing graduation and my last semester of college to COVID was extremely hard on me. I’d count my online “graduation” day as one of the lowest points of my life because I was so depressed over it. No closure, no saying goodbye to the few people I was close with, no celebration for four years of hard work. I’m still not over it. 

Fast forward to now. I somehow managed to get a job but it leaves me bored and underwhelmed because it is a watered down version of my major. I cannot afford to move out and so I live with my parents. I do not have a SINGLE friend here. Not that I could go do much with them anyway. I have spent more time in my bed on the internet this year than I ever have, it’s all I do.

I read a post today about how everyone will miss their twenties and it’s the best time of your life and it just made me sob. This is it? This is the best it gets? Then I don’t know if I want to live through the rest of it all. I’m alone and at home and sad and directionless and soon I have to move to fucking Florida with my parents and deal with a bunch of anti-masking antagonists.

I can’t afford therapy, either. Every time I drive out to the grocery store alone, I cry, because that’s the only time I have any privacy from my parents (I work from home) and all of this hits me at once.

Went to university and my dorms student halls quickly became a COVID19 hotspot and I left. Didn't wanna get covid19 and no one seemed to care about it. Been at home since September and everyday is just the same. I wake up, stare at a screen study, eat, maybe watch a few shows now and then and then sleep.

15,"Sick with anxiety. Mom exposed. Reassurance? Support? I live with my mom, shes 63 and therefore high risk so we've been meticulously careful since March. However we found out she was exposed during a dental cleaning. The hygienist who saw her tested positive for covid AND strep throat. I am absolutely terrified.

Her appointment was 10 AM on Friday the 4th. She wore a filtered cloth mask whenever she wasn't in the chair. There was no waiting room, they got her from her car right at 10. Her hygienist wore a surgical mask the entire time properly. Mom mentioned the girl coughed 1 time during the xray portion when she was handling the big machine down near my moms feet (as far as i know a quick ""clear the throat"" kind of everyday cough). My mom was out of the office by 11. So a guess would be the cleaning and xray portion took about 45 minutes.

Sunday evening around 6 or 7 pm we get a call informing us that hygienist tested positive for covid and strep throat. Symptoms prompted her to get a test it wasn't just a formality for work. Hygienist was asymptomatic during the Friday appointment (she seemed perfectly fine beyond that one tiny cough).

My head has been spinning since we got that phone call. We pick up groceries, wear masks, sanitize, etc. I had told her to initially cancel the appointment or postpone and I wish so much that I'd pushed harder for that. But we are where we are.

18,"Lost Job, Depression, Moved in w/ Toxic Family, No Hope I am not particularly a venter, so I'll try to keep it short here, as I also don't expect people to read or reply, but it might be cathartic to share my experience.

For context, I am 24, skinny, introverted, kind of antisocial (workin on it) person (also known as INTP if you're into psychoanalysis). I have a uni degree in marketing, but I hate marketing/sales because too much human behavior to account for. I studied abroad in Korea during uni and it changed my life. I've gone back 5 times, am intermediate in the language, and have been wanting to live there for 5 years now. Worked as a Data Analyst for startup in 2018-19, quit to live in Japan for free with friend for 6 weeks, came back and started working for UKpany in Feb 2020.

**Lost Job**

I have been inside, quarantining diligently since March. I only go to get grocery/convenience store and visit an also quarantining friend. I lost my job as a Data Analyst in June, but decided to stay in my 1BR expensive southern CA apartment to avoid moving back to the middle of nowhere with my toxic family. The pandemic UEI money was good, basically my salary, so things were fine at first financially, but my depression and stress were getting worse.

The pandemic money expired and I was starting to get worried. I have over 100 job applications out. Throughout them, I got 2 interviews. The first one was product management that I wasn't qualified for, but I had a reference, so I'm not even mad I didn't get it, just thought I'd try. The other, I did the interview in Sept for a job I applied for in July (which half of the panel didn't show up to) and then they ignored my inquiries for weeks after. Eventually they asked if I was still interested (uhhh pardon? you're ignoring me). I told them I was interested and then got hit with auto ""out of office"" emails, and no reply since. Feels like shit. They're still posting the job online too.

I saw a LinkedIn post of this woman saying she became depressed after 50 applications and no replies, until someone called her and she was hired on first interview. 120,000 likes on her post and 7kments telling her she's strong. I have objectively put more effort into my attempt for survival and people spit on it saying I should have double the applications out, but there's simply not that many jobs I'm qualified for, and theres a pool of people with more experience than me.

**Moved back to toxic family house**

Novemberes around and I don't want to hemorrhage more money than I was since the pandemic money stopped. I just moved back with my family, in the middle of nowhere, a week ago. When I say middle of nowhere I mean it takes 20 miles to get to Target. Its a town of Trump-heads and dirt. I am staying in a ""guest room"" and have to keep my stuff in the garage because my dad ""doesn't want to rearrange the guest room"" since my sister is supposed to buy a house (she has failed to close on anything so far). 

My sister is a white trash single mom of two who lives here with her kids. There are also 5 dogs in this house. They shit and piss all over the floor and the kids are constantly making noise and throwing fits. I am forced to sit at a desk in the corner of the living room and listen to all of this. My dad is the type to never let you win a conversation that wasn't a contest in the first place. I can't tell him anything interesting. He tries to relate to me and act like a family man, but he will often disrespect me or get offended if I say anything that doesn't confirm hisments. It's basically gaslighting.

**Future is ambiguous?**

As I mentioned before, I briefly lived in Korea during uni and have visited many times. I want to go back, more than anything. And that's not some ""I need to leave the COVID country"" shit. That's what I've been saying since 2016. I got a certificate to teach English, but have hesitated to pull the trigger because my dad makes me feel like shit for wanting to do something that doesn't have an obvious path (but then again what does), and I am also concerned that I am not animated enough to be in front of kids all day (I'm not bubbly, but I am very smart and can teach, but that barely matters to these private academies that just need a white jester to entertain students). 

I'm now considering pursuing graduate degree in international studies in Seoul, but applications aren't until Feb and I wouldn't start until Fall. I don't even know if I'd get in, or what I would do with that degree necessarily. Not sure how I would pay for it either (I only have $10,000 rn maybe 15 if I sell assets). No one will talk to me about it, friends just say ""broo nooo you can't leave"" as if I'm not on the edge of killing myself.

If I don't go to Korea, will I just continue to suffer here until I take the first occupation I can get? Potentially dislike it just as I did my last job? Sure I can move out again or whatever if I make the money but I'm in CA, $1200-$1500 a month for rent just to not live in a toxic household seems like a kick in the dick.

**Final Thoughts**

I am so empty, lonely, and scared. I have no hope for anything moving forward in my life. I am so alone. I can't even talk to my 2 friends that I have because I sound like a broken record, and they didn't lose their jobs so they just keep saying ""something good wille around"" which makes me feel worse when nothing does. I LITERALLY haven't interacted with a stranger in 9 months (besides the job interviews). I am 5'10 and 125lbs, I am malnourished, my back has hurt for a year, I get winded going up the stairs, I eat <1000 calories a day. I say I want to get fit but eating 2000+ calories makes me feel sick (nutritionist says I need 3000+ to gain weight) and trying to implement a new lifestyle habit (exercise) is VERY difficult when you are alone in life.

I can't look people in the eyes when I go to the grocery store or something (masked and distanced of course). I haven't had sex in nearly a year, and have been single for four years. Porn addiction crippling my will to interact with women and has previously left me unable to 'perform' despite ability to get girls quite easily. I just want something or someone to make me feel like staying alive is worth it. I just want to say ""I love you"" or ""I love me"" or even ""I love this"" and genuinely feel it in my chest.

19,"My uncle passed away with Covid. I don’t know what to say or what to think right now so sorry if my thoughts are scattered and chaotic.
My aunt and my uncle are my only family left. He contracted the virus and his condition deteriorated pretty fast. We went to the ER last Saturday because he couldn’t breathe and they told us that since he’s not dying they won’t take him in the hospital and it’s late at night anyway.
On the 2nd of December he couldn’t even take a breath so they finally admitted him in the hospital. They started treatment and everything was fine until today... They called my aunt and told her they did everything they could but he passed away...
I still can’t process it, I’m scared cause my aunt has a heart condition.. this disease is terrible. I hate it. I hate this whole year. I hate everyone who don’t believe in the virus, I hate the doctors that sent my uncle home last Saturday. 
I just hope he finds peace wherever he is now and that my aunt is well. I don’t know what to say really. This is hell.

20,"I know I'm doing the right thing, but I am so dang tired of doing the right thing I had a baby in January, I'm a first time mom. Of course I had plans for my kid. We lived in a one bedroom apartment in the city, but who needs a big place when you can go to museums and the library and friends houses?

So the pandemic hit, everything... literally everything... changed. 

We moved to a rural area to make sure my kid has space. He is surrounded by toys, more toys than I ever fathomed getting, but i am desperate to keep him stimulated. No screens? Yeah right.

The last time he was held by anyone other than immediate family was 8 months ago. He has never seen another baby or child apart from on TV or a distant stroller when we go for walks.

Now with how people are trading the holidays, it's clear this isn't getting better any time soon. When will be start day care? When will be meet people? I don't know. 

I know so many other new moms who are just risking it to allow their babies normalcy, and so far none of them have gotten sick. So they think I'm crazy and paranoid.

Saturday morning I ended up in the ER with severe pain that turned out to be a small bowel obstruction and twist. Stayed there until Sunday evening. During that time on Saturday I realized I cried multiple times (almost had to get emergency surgery. Thankfully it cleared.) and wiped my eyes without washing my hands. I wasn’t even thinking about it because I was alone and scared at the prospect of part of my intestine being cut out.

I stayed on the surgery floor where no covid patients are allowed. But I went through the unit they are in briefly on a wheelchair (I had a mask on)

Today I just feel very very weak and I had a temp of 99.8. I had a covid test done on Saturday in case of surgery and it was negative. I’m not sure I feel like this because of barely eating for two days, being in pain, and being stressed out. Or if I could have caught covid.

24,"On not being okay ever again I recently read a post on here about someone who was trying to cope with the fact that they may never be okay ever again. When I read that I literally almost cried based on how accurate it was to my situation. Something broke inside of me during this pandemic. Something I'm not sure I will ever get back.

I've always struggled with my mental health battling OCD, abandonment issues, self-harm tendencies, and child sexual abuse (I'm male), and I really thought things were looking brighter at the beginning of 2020. My life was almost perfect and I was slowly getting over my past traumas. Then the virus hit, and I got sent home from college, away from everyone else. My mental illness has gotten infinitely worse, and my health suffered as a result. Now, Every day I am in constant pain and anguish because of my anxiety making random pains and sensations in my body worse.  

This whole situation also opened my eyes to how people really are. Even the people I know. Everyone just stopped contacting me even though they would all hang out with their own friends, hell even my FWB who I had developed feelings for prior to this whole thing ghosted me just recently. I really really liked her, and it hit me so fucking hard when I realized she'd never text me back again. It fucking hurts when you realize that at your worst there is no one there who could give 2 fucks about you. This whole thing has just reinforced the idea to me that no one fucking cares about me, I have no one. I'm better off fending for myself 

Everyone now just seems like a bunch of selfish fucks. Covid is all over my family (Hispanic) but they're all fucking making parties, hanging around, and passing it to the vulnerable in our family. Some have already died. They DO NOT CARE. I really don't want to get too political here, but this election opened my eyes as to how many selfish and horrible people we have in this country. I just can't see my brothers the same way again.

It probably didn't help that I took maximum allowed units this quarter so I'm drowning in schoolwork, but my mental health over this period has declined so rapidly that I seriously don't think I can ever be okay again. I will never be the happy, loving person I was when 2020 started. I had a girlfriend who I loved at the time, lots of friends that I thought had my back, and the hope that my past was finally my past. So whoever made that other post, I feel you. I feel you so fucking much. I want my old self back,

25,"Canada Vaccine Worries This seems so ridiculous to post considering all the other hardships everyone is facing. 

I am seeing a lot of vaccine news for other parts of the world and that’s great. I am very extroverted and spend a lot of my time with my American friends travelling for concerts etc so this year has been really hard. I also have a child who was born in January so I feel like he’s missed out on his first year of life. We are severely locked down where I live (central Canada) and not allowed to visit with anyone. He had Christmas photos booked and they were cancelled. So there are no professional photos of my son’s first year of life. That time is just gone.

In Canada, we have been told by Trudeau that they expect half of Canadians to be vaccinated by September 2021. In my province, they said we will be in lockdown for many more months, likely a year. I’m really struggling watching my friends say that they’ll have their lives back to normal in the summer, and that they concerts that were all pushed to next year will be happening. Meanwhile the seats I have will be empty, because Canada is lagging behind.

A political podcast I listen to said that it’s going to be hard for Canadians to watch the rest of the world start toe out of lockdowns while we’re still struggling. I feel like I’ll be one of the last in the country to get it because I don’t live in an “important province” and I’m fairly young.

I am also in a lot of pain physically as I am waiting on elective surgery to have my gallbladder removed. I was in the hospital earlier this year due to gallstones and I’m really scared now that’ll happen again. I am following a strict diet but even something as simple as a salad can trigger a trip to the ER.

27,"Feeling like I overreacted to an ""exposure"" I hope this doesn't break the ranting rule, but I don't know which subreddit to post in. I've been feeling overwhelmed and like I'm in a different reality, hoping I'm not the only one. I'm a wage worker for a bigpany. I'm informed two coworkers (roommates) tested positive, I worked with them 4 and 2 days earlier respectively. I quarantine immediately because my parent is high-risk (+ had surgery). I misunderstood my boss (B) and thought we'd *all* 14-day quarantine (and be paid), but it only applied if you're positive. My rapid test was negative, so B said toe in the next day.

I thought symptoms could show up to 14 days post-exposure? It was 8-10 days for my brother. Although he tested positive before they started, so maybe I'm overreacting? But even my doctor rmended 14 days. We do wear masks, but we're not always 6 feet apart. On my last day, I absentmindedly grabbed food B brought us in an open box in the break room. I told B I'd rather quarantine and re-test. She said everything was sanitized and since I was negative, I had toe back. If I insisted, it'd be considered asking for time off and she ""wasn't sure if her boss would approve it"" - also no pay. I said I'd still do it.

I never got a response about my ""time off"". I saw the CDC lowered to 10 days and thought I'dpromise, so I sent a text to say my first day back would actually be X (I was scheduled before then). I got back a passive-aggressive message that I didn't have a proper excuse and at that point, I was just choosing to not show up for work. Almost all of my coworkers are back and I'm feeling embarrassed/guilty. I started to have inner doubts and conflicted between things I've read by sources like the CDC and what those around me are actually doing. The whole pandemic has been stressful enough and this situation hasn't helped. I genuinely start to feel delusional and wonder if I'm overreacting.

28,"This whole crisis is really taking a toll on my mental health First, I want to caveat that I'm incredibly fortunate that I've lost no one to Covid and I've managed to retain a job throughout the crisis, but I'm seriously reaching the end of my tether. I (25M) was dealing with severe issues with depression and anxiety just prior to the crisis, that actually resulted in me taking time off work. I feel like I was just starting to take steps to manage my issues when the pandemic struck. It's been and up and down journey ever since, especially with one of the major sources of my depression/anxiety, which is my IBS, which has had a crippling effect on me at times. Mostly, it's just been monotonous and lonely. Day after day in an unfriendly houseshare slaving away at a laptop, and just feeling like I'm losing touch with all sources of connection and humanity. I have friends, but we're meeting semi-infrequently as most of them don't live particularly near me. I would consider myself a fairly outgoing person and I need people, so to feel so isolated has been pretty tough. I've just be more and more despondent about my romantic prospects, my relationships, my career, and just feeling like I've wasted and am wasting my life. I keep beating myself up in my head that I didn't take steps to resolve my issues with depression/anxiety sooner, so I was in a better living situation/support network during the pandemic. It seems like most days I'm in an endless cycle of rumination and self-criticism, that I just can't seem to escape.

Having lurked on this sub for a bit, I'm aware that a lot of people my age are going through similar issues. It just feels like life is passing by and I'm losing touch with everything I liked about myself. I'm trying to stay positive by carrying on with hobbies like tennis, reading etc, but I'm just struggling to carry on and dealing with a lot of suicidal thoughts. I started taking Sertraline three weeks ago and I am doing a course of CBT, but so far I've mainly dealt with the side of effects of the antidepressant rather than any major benefits. I just honestly don't know how Ie back from this, given how much I was struggling even before the crisis. I feel like things are marginally improving, but I also feel like I'm losing the prime years of my life to physical health and mental health issues.

34,"Would enjoy some cold, hard facts about the longevity of the disease My mind is still haunted by the idea of ""long COVID"". It's pretty much the only thing about the bug I actually fear. I'm quarantining myself quite effectively whenpared to most of my peers (because the cases have been so low, everyone else has had mostly a normal autumn, albeit wearing masks and washing hands more). Currently, the cases are on the rise again and more people are joining me in the temporarily solitary lifestyle.

My mum and dad are old enough to be on an elevated risk, with my mum having actual health conditions. Both have been staying at home since March, with visits to them being extremely few. My pa can't work from home but he and his workplace take safety quite seriously. My mum, on the other hand, has been working remotely for a good while. 

I'm not particularly worried about anyone in my family *dying* of the disease. It has such a low mortality rate, plus the cases are still quite low. And both my parents and I do extra work to stay safe, at least whenpared to others around here. The chances of someone dying are simply astronomical. I do worry a little, of course, but it never reaches unreasonable amounts.

As I said, what I do worry about is the long-term effects. Some people say that the disease causes brain damage with a few years delay, regardless of the severity of the illness. Heart damage on non-symptomatic people [has already been observed]( so it is hardly a long shot. Since the pandemic was declared, I have had a nagging feeling that the mortality rate will start rising sharply after a couple of years. My worst fear is that the eventual vaccine(s) will not only fail to protect the receiver from these symptoms, but may even cause them in him or her. Bad virus proteins in a rushed vaccine ending up lodged in the brain, preventing proper sleep for the rest of one's life and so on. I heard this hypothesis from a not-particularly-credible source, but my fear is still very real.

It has been of zerofort that I have experienced what appears to be low blood pressure (ears ringing, vision dimming, dizziness and nausea) from relatively mild exercise. Usually it happens when I'm doing an exercise focused on either few big muscles (riding a bike uphill, running, doing press-ups) or a large group of smaller muscles (scaling a difficult obstacle course that requires both arms and legs without pause). But now I felt like I almost fainted on the floor by simply playing Ring Fit Adventure and doing lots of wide squats and planks in quick succession; something I was previously able to do without issues supposedly relating to blood pressure. Before, I would not want to throw up on the floor: I would simply be tired afterwards. Perhaps I haven't just had enough exercise lately, but the alternative is that I have had the bug without knowing and am now literally heartbroken, with years of my future lost to an eventual, early death.

Sometimes, the dizzinesses from very minor mental stress when I'm playing a game I enjoy. This type of dizziness only lasts a few seconds, and only when I think about losing in the game (it's elimination-based), but it's still odd as it has not occurred before, really. I am familiar with the feeling, but it has normally only occurred when I am about to mess something up very, very badly, like missing the only train to my destination and having zero backup possibilities. I am wondering if this might be my brain getting tired of long-term stress and finally giving in. During my history of heavy periods of anxiety, I have not previously had any physical symptoms. 

TLDR: COVID-19 has been observed to damage one's body even if the patient was not symptomatic. Scared that the damage might be severely life-impairing, or even lethal, after a few years. My own body has expressed things that could potentially suggest me having had the disease asymptomatic and my body now being damaged in this way.

I came back to my apartment to finish out my quarantine and after two negative tests, finally saw some friends. Midway through the night, I get a call from my mom asking if I've started quarantining to make sure I can spend Christmas with them.

I mentioned at Thanksgiving how pissed off I was at the whole situation, and that I only came home because I thought it was safe. I've seen my family a few times since the pandemic began, spending an almost 2 monthsbined at their house, and every time I have spent a few days before an after isolating so as to be responsible. I am royally pissed at my dad and sister, and also don't want toe back for Christmas because 1. It's just inherently unsafe with cases where they are now. 3. I've seen them a bunch already this year 2. If I go home for Christmas, with 2 weeks on either end of Thanksgiving and Christmas to isolate, that means I will have not seen any friends or anything in two months (if it's safe - I have a pod of three friends that all WFH and we only hang out with each other) just so I can go have a sad meal with my parents. I don't like having to sacrifice my own life to make them happy. I hate to disappoint my mother and make her upset on the holidays, but I feel as though I have seen them a bunch this year and it is especially unsafe right now. Not to mention I don't want to be the only one responsible for my mother's happiness.

There is a lot of drama in my family about me being the sole one responsible for my mom's happiness, and both she and the rest of my family are guilting me intoing home when I don't feel safe about it and personally don't want to forgive my dad and sister for lying about their COVID exposure on Thanksgiving, and hope this will maybe be a wakeup call for them that they need to respect me as well.

40,"Not sleeping well day after day - feeling bored with lockdown Anyone else?

I could actually go to sleep, but just psychologically so bored of ""wake, remotely online work, TV, chat to my roommate about Trump (again), bed, mediocre alone-adult-time, sleep"" - day after day after day. So I just spend hours doom scrolling on reddit and twitter during the night, just to feel some kind of stimulation.

The news of the vaccine is great, however the fact that it's gonna take like another year or two until it reaches the majority of the population and life returns to normal - this reality has me feeling crazily impatient and bored. Waiting... waiting. *Oh my god can I do another year of this?*

I've been so worried because they all work in risky indistries- mom is a teacher, dad is a cop, brother works at Walmart, and sister at a rehab hospital. I felt like someone was bound to get sick. Well, it happened... We were over there last Sunday for brunch, maybe there a total of 2 hours and left. His mom held baby for a few minutes. A few days ago, his brother tested positive for Covid. While I was really worried, I had some hope we wouldn't get it because he never touched us or baby, just was in the same room for a few minutes. Everyone else's rapid tests came back negative. We went on quarantine and scheduled a test for yesterday just to be safe. Well MIL's test was a false negative. Her regular test results (the one that takes a couple days) came back yesterday and it was positive. We hugged her and she held our baby! Now I'm terrified we are going to get it too. I'd never forgive myself if our baby got sick. We got tested yesterday, no symptoms up until then. The test made my nose runny and by dinner time that nostril was all stuffed up.

44,"Terrified that I got COVID from a homeless guy while eating outside I'm a 33-year-old man with no major health issues (other than being slightly overweight according to my BMI) and I live in the SF Bay Area. I've been taking all the normal precautions with respect to COVID - wearing masks, washing my hands, etc. Today, just a few hours ago, I decided to go eat lunch at a restaurant on University Avenue in Palo Alto. Of course, I was eating outside. While I was eating, I was not wearing my mask.

About halfway through my meal, a homeless guy who was obviously mentally ill - he was talking to himself and shouting obscenities at women passing by - stopped by my table and started harassing me. I froze. I didn't know what to do. I just looked straight ahead and hoped he would go away on his own. I made very little eye contact with him. I didn't even think to put my mask back on. I was more afraid of getting assaulted or something.

After a minute or two, he finally left. But not before coughing. He didn't cough directly at me, but he also didn't cough directly away from me. When he coughed, he was standing maybe 3-4 feet away from me. I have no idea if it was a cough from COVID or just a regular cough from irritation or dry air or something.

Since then, I've been terrified that I caught the disease from him. I have no idea whether or not he has the virus, but I can't help but think that I somehow brought this on myself.

48,"Got together for Thanksgiving, family is now positive, feeling ashamed. My family has been through a difficult year, but we have all been very careful and have followed guidelines to the best of our abilities. My brother is in the military and begins deployment in a few weeks, so we made the decision to gather for Thanksgiving because it was important that we were together. We knew the risk but we were all cautious, and now we are all positive.

I am a first year law student. I live alone, I've been taking classes online and was only seeing a neighbor/classmate who is also isolating. My brother drove in from a neighboring state. My grandma, aunt and uncle drove in from a neighboring state. My sister and her husband and children quarantined before Thanksgiving. My dad has been able to work from home, but my mom has not. She does have her own office with a door and everyone abides by the office's mask policies.

My brother, his wife, my sister, her kids, both my parents, my grandma, and myself have now all tested positive. I'm trying to take law school final exams with brain fog, headache, nausea, and joint pain. My parents, who are very healthy for their age, are having a very difficult time - my dad's fever has been high and persistent and finally (thankfully) started to decrease last night. My sister and her kids are depressed. My grandma is angry. My aunt and uncle, negative so far, are very poor and are unable to get any paid leave while they quarantine from work.

My mom and I keep saying that one of the most unexpected things we are dealing with is the sense of shame and judgment. No, we didn't follow the guidelines. We made a difficult choice to do what was right for our family. I had not seen my brother for so long, and the idea that he could potentially nevere home from overseas was what made us all decide that it was worth the risk. And we were careful. And now we're all suffering, and anxious that one of us will take a turn for the worse. I feel like if I tell anyone, I have to justify to them why I thought it was ok to get together for Thanksgiving.

Meanwhile, people in mymunity are being reckless and are paying no consequences. I feel so frustrated because my apartment is above a local restaurant and I hear people eating, laughing, getting drunk, having a great time down there without any masks or social distancing.

51,"I don't know if I can survive this, nor if I even want or deserve to anymore. Posted in here about a week and a half ago about worrying I was going to lose the few things that have gotten me through this so far. Ended up canceling the camping trip we were going to go on, since we couldn't find clear guidance about what exactly we were and weren't allowed to do.

Anyway, it's happened. As of later this weekend my area will have banned all in-person gathering outside one's household. Even outdoors, socially distanced, and with masks. (Although for some reason they're allowing and even encouraging things like outdoor fitness classes...as long as you're not there with anyone you actually care about seeing, it's fine to get together, I guess?) 

They say it's temporary - supposedly only a few weeks, until there's less danger of hospitals getting overwhelmed. I have no reason to believe it will change before next summer or even later, because the rules we already had have barely been enforced, and so the people who have been ignoring precautions all along without consequences are going to keep doing so, while those of us who are trying to do the right thing while keeping our sanity just lost the one lifeline we had for safely doing so. I am not going to survive this if it lasts more than a few weeks. I don't know if I even want to try to survive it anymore. We've been ""temporarily sacrificing"" everything for almost a year, and increasingly being told that all we're ever getting back is ""a new normal"" or ""some semblance of normal.""  Even if this does end, I'm afraid that everyone and everything I care about will be gone by the time it's over. Honestly, I'm less and less hopeful there will ever be anything worth sticking around for again. 

I feel like a piece of shit for even being upset about this, after seeing a ton of people I know talk about how anyone who will have their lives affected by new stay at home orders is part of the problem.

Well her flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours and had time to kill as her flight was running super late. I was in a rental car she payed for and went through a drive through covid testing center to 'be safe' as I heard if you have a fever you could have it. I was worried (as I work around people) that I might give it to my sister. So I had the 'quickest test done' and filled some stuff out my information on my phone. I searched a place and found one within 10min or so. It was called StarMed. I got a call a little while later and it was positive. I hadn't picked my sister up yet and was in a panic at first but decided to not pick my sister up and Venmo her uber money. I called my work, which I was already off that day and they told me to stay home for the next 2 weeks. I am not getting paid or anything but I really would hate to give it to anyone and be responsible for the sickness of anyone else. My sister ended up staying with a friend and she ended up getting the rental car the next day and worked it all out. She was fine.

So I spent the next 4 days in bed and avoiding everyone including the fedex guy with a note on my door. So Friday around 4:30 my boss calls and wants to know what's going on, as he heard I got my covid diagnosis from my other manager on shift. Why he waited till Friday to notify me idk. So he wants proof of my covid diagnosis. Um ok. I tell him where I got it done and I still had my StarMed reference number text on my phone from where I signed up in the drive through. No he wants my positive paperwork faxed to him by Monday. He was being weird so I call StarMed and talk to a receptionist and she was really nice. 100% loved her but she dosent have access to the rapid tests. She takes my information and tells me she will call me back.

So Saturday. I get a call from another sweet receptionist and she admits she can't find my test. She isn't sure but tells me I am not the only one. She can see me in the system and has my information, Birthday ect but the test isn't on my information. I ask her how I was called and notified positive and she reassures me that I was given accurate information and to just quarantine. That they 'called me after my test result came in and it just wasnt transferred onto my online profile after I was called as they are so busy trying to do as many as quick as possible.'  I tell her I need paperwork and to sent in to my work. She says I cane in for a regular test. But if my boss wants to call she 'will make a note and she will tell him what happened.' That when they 'go through all of the paperwork it will more than likely get transferred to my online information but it will take a while as they have hundreds of boxes of tests.' That if it is urgent, she will fit me in whenever I want for another test if I have to have paperwork now and they will print it out while I am there. Which would mean calling a uber and exposing more people to covid and paying more money I can't afford.

I don't want to expose anyone else and just don't feel well and want to rest. I don't know why my boss is being such a jerk, and I basically fell like I was called a liar. I called him Saturday and told him he could call the place I went to and talk to receptionist  but he wants paperwork faxed to him with ""attention:James"" or he will assume this was my 2 weeks notice.

I have a question...

So, I got sick two days ago with some stomach issues (unfortunately not a new thing for me), but just to be extra sure, I went a found myself a Covid test. I'm still waiting for results (it could be today or tomorrow before they're back).

I had been throwing up, so my wonderful bf drove me to my test and back. He stopped at a drive through on the way home to grab us some food. He didn't think much of it because no one was dealing with me directly, as I am across the car from any workers. Also, the drive through have sneeze guards up and the workers are wearing masks, which is nice to see. Also, they get people through in under 5 minutes, which is actually a positive to the whole Covid thing. No more long lines! 

I got to thinking about it, though, because we go grocery shopping on the weekends and we're nearly out of food at the moment. I can't go out and shop because I'm quarantining until I know I'm negative. 

Would it be safe for him to grab us food? Our pets need food, too. My testing hit us at a kinda bad time. : ( 

I'm not one to buy up tons of stuff all at once because others need it, too. Hoarders make things really hard for people during times like these. 

So... We're kinda out of stuff. We also don't get delivery services here (rural hick town lol) we either go out and get it or we don't get it. 

What do y'all think?

He's not shown a single symptom of literally anything other than his normal asthma.

58,"Jealousy over friend getting vaccine I just learned that my friend who has behaved the most irresponsibly out of anyone I know during the pandemic will get the vaccine next week, just because he works for the government in a non-essential role.

It's sent my feelings that the vaccine is being unfairly distributed into the stratosphere, even as I realize my feelings are crazy.

It just drives me nuts to know that people will get the vaccine before me. I understand giving it to doctors, but to prisoners? I didn'tmit any crimes, and I'm getting screwed! I also don't get giving it to people my age (30s) who have pre-existing conditions, so they can resume their lives while I sit around.

It's just crazy to me that this whole pandemic response has been a disaster from the start, but suddenly when ites to the vaccine everything has to be apportioned just the right way — screwing over all the non-vulnerable people who have sacrificed a year+ of our lives to keep other people alive.

At the same time, I know we want to save as many lives as possible, and it makes sense to give it to vulnerable people first. But I still have these feelings! It's also crazy to me that there isn't more of a debate about this.

I think a good amount of the vaccine (maybe 30 million doses) should instead be distributed early via lottery to non-vulnerable people who otherwise would be in the back of the line, as an acknowledgment of the sacrifices we've made to keep other people alive. I think it would help people survive this winter, and feel like the whole system is fairer to all of us.

I think my feelings have been aggravated by all of my friends acting like I'm crazy.

I feel like this could just be a panic attack (although i've never had one)? I've been so stressed with school and the possibility of having COVID (e.g. false negative tests). Not sure if I am tricking myself into thinking I have symptoms when I don't.

60,"How do you stop being so angry? I feel like I'm going crazy.  My family and I have been very cautious since the start, especially since my mom is very high risk. It's been a no brainer for me to always take every precaution and limit my exposure as much as I possibly can because if I don't,  I very well could lose my mom. I haven't wavered in that at all. 

But as time goes on, I'm bing more and more angry with those that aren't as cautious as I am. I see someone at the grocery store with their nose out of their mask and I get frustrated inside and I carry that with me all day. I don't even know anymore if the anger is justified. I don't even know if I am doing the right thing anymore. 

Now my immediate family members (not my mom) have slowly been letting their guard down even though numbers are going up. I can't help but see that as ""the thing I want to do with my friend is more important than my mom's health"". But I know that's very black and white thinking and they certainly don't think that in any capacity. 

I'm just angry and tired and sad. 

I look at anti maskers and people who aren't taking covid seriously in such a bad light. I don't want feel that way about them anymore.

62,"I am afraid that this pandemic will trully never be over 

Hello guys, 

The last few months (maybe with an exception of summer) were pretty hard for me. Just before the pandemic I moved into a new city, I was hoping to make some friends, socialise, go to the gym, clubs etc. At the moment I work at home, I only go out to buy some groceries. It has already been said, that those measures will stay here in Germany for at least one month, but we all know that they will start to relax in April. 

Since the beginning of the pandemic in March I am on this strange rollercoaster, going from thinking ""ok, this is how we will live right now, at least we will get summer"" to ""I dont want to live like that anymore"". To make matters worse, I am considered to be a covid-denier because I criticise the actions takens by the governments all over the world.

I am convinced, that this pandemic will not end and that we can forget about a life we had back in 2019. Clubs, stadiums, parties, convents, expos - its over. For good. Maybe we will be able to go to the gym and restaurants in the Summer. During Autumn and Winter though we will be having lockdowns, almost every year. It is really hard at the moment, I am single male 29, and meeting somebody is pretty f.... hard nowadays. The problem however - I dont see any perspective. Even some virologist and other experts write in their articles that there is no going back and we need to discuss if we want to reopen clubs - because maybe they are already obsolete and they do not fit the brave new world. 

I have given myself some time untill the end of the next year, if the situation will not improve, I will start to look for another place to live. It does not make sense to live like that.",28,0.92,k6xkmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k6xkmq/i_am_afraid_that_this_pandemic_will_trully_never/,57,Support,2020-12-05,-4,94,-0.0425531914893617

64,"I have to accept the fact that I won't be OK again. Before I start this post, I want to apologize if thises off as rambly at all. I just need to let my thoughts out.

This past year has destroyed my mental health. Before this, I was in college and was taking steps to better myself. I was sent home in March, and had to spend last spring and this fall taking classes in my room alone. To say that these past 8 months destroyed my mental health would be an understatement. 

To start, I'm stuck in the closet at home for the forseeable future, so I couldn't bind or dress or be referred to the way I would like to. My friends from college mostly didn't keep in touch, and this fall, my two friends who live in my town went back to school and because they had their lives back, they didn't talk to me at all. I feltpletely isolated, and could go over a week without talking to anyone besides my parents. And even if my friends would talk to me, it was a quick text-nothing more. This semester is also the most intense for my major, and I'm absolutely piled with work. Plus, the Earth in general just feels overwhelmingly depressing. Like, sunsets used to be my favorite time of day, and I feel like the sky hasn't even had an actual sunset since March. Nothing has any life anymore.

Every day for the past 8 months has been the same- wake up, stare at my phone, stare at myputer, sleep, rinse and repeat.  I don't even have any memories of this year, at all. Its just a big blank in my head. The only healthy coping mechanism I have is running, and now its even getting too cold for that. Between the anxiety from the news, the stress from school, the loneliness, the emptiness I feel every day, the overwhelming depressing content on social media, I just feel empty inside. I can't care about anyone or anything anymore. I've never felt this terrible in my life before. I made plans to kill myself two times this year; I was planning on doing it over the summer  and on November 1st, but I chickened out each time. The worst part is that I regret not doing it. The literal only thing keeping me from planning on trying again is that I'm getting a Playstation for Christmas. 

My school announced that we're doing this spring semester online again too-so that means another 5 months of this hell. Over a year and a half of feeling trapped. I really feel like I'm not gonna make it. My parents keep telling me that the end is near because we're getting the vaccine, but it's hard to feel hopeful. The goalposts keep moving so many times that it's hard to feel anything. I feel like my mental health has been damaged to the point beyond repair. I feel like even if I go to therapy, I'm never going to be the same way that I was before the pandemic. I'm going to carry this with me for the rest of my life. How do I live with this?

It was great news that the Pfizer vaccine was approved in the UK earlier this week, which raises the prospect that this and other vaccines will be approved around the world soon ish.

However, I'm kinda growing increasingly anxious about the fact that a mere mortal, healthy-ish adult like me will have to wait months for the vaccine.

At first I was feeling okay that there would be a good chance I could receive the vaccine by March or April ish based on what media sources have been reporting, a wait I would have been fine with.

However, everytime I look at the news the prospective date gets delayed further and further. First it was March/April, then May, then June, and now it's July. 

Granted, these pieces of reportinge from sites that have been known for intentionally fearmongering with their articles throughout the pandemic (looking at you, CNN and NYT) but I can't cope with the thought that it might be THAT long before my life can be a little more more normal with the release of the vaccine.

My life and career prospects have beenpletely ruined by the government's response to covid, with no guarantee that I'll ever be able to break back in to that extremely niche industry, and I'm a very social person so the threat of fines for seeing my friends and the inability to have large gatherings (I live in a place with very a strict, yet ineffective, partial lockdown still where it's illegal to socialize with even one person from outside your home with no sign of stopping) has had a huge effect on my mental health. 

The news of several vaccines seemed to be a sigh of relief. I thought, great, only a couple more months of this before enough people get vaccinated thatmunity spread drops to a point that we can loosen the harsh restrictions. But, nearly as soon as news of the vaccines came out, articles saying that even after a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, we'll still have to keep these measures ""just to be safe."" I don't understand this obsession with sacrificing everything that makes life worth living indefinitely ""just to be safe."" 

I know that these articles are probably just overly shocking and negative to get more people to look at them, but it just adds to the feeling that this will never end. The hospitals near capacity every flu season where I'm from; does this set a precedent that business closures and banning any social gatherings is justified every year when the hospitals near capacity? There will always be some risk in leaving your house, and I understand that the elevated level of risk now warrants some extra precautions, but it really feels like this will never end and governments (especially those outside of the United States) will refuse to abandon some of these measures regardless of how many people get vaccinated. I don't know how much longer I can or want to live in that kind of world.

Now... Yesterday as I wasing home, my check engine light came on. My luck is just *stellar*, let me tell you lol

It's probably related to needing an oil change. I have barely been able to afford to *pay attention*, so an oil change did not happen when it should have. I'm around 700 miles over, actually.

I do not have another vehicle. That's rich people shit lol

So... My big question is... Is it safe for the people doing my oil change if I go get it done before idling in a long line for a Covid test. 

The whole reason I wanted one is because I work with the public in healthcare. But now, this morning, I am sick to my stomach. So, I am symptomatic with *something*. Cold, flu, and stomach virus season is here, too. 

So... What do you all think? Is there a safe way to do this? 

Should I try another route?

What ancient elder god did I make angry and how do I fix it?

Thanks everyone!

::EDIT::

Good news! My bf went with me to get the oil changed so all I had to do is sit in the passenger seat and wear a mask. He did all the talking and interaction as he is not showing any signs of sickness.

On the way back, he went through a drive through in less than 5 minutes and I managed to eat a bit and can drink water. 

I was masked up from start to finish and didn't talk a lot so I wouldn't project anything gross around.

We normally grocery shop on the weekends and don't really have a whole lot of food in the house right now. We also don't get grocery delivery here, which blows. 

But I can at least hold food and water down and now I'm sitting at home waiting for my appointment, which he's going to take me too, as well. 

I'll definitely let y'all know how it turns out for me! I have high hopes that it's a stomach bug rather than something more serious.

79,"Delayed cross country move - did I make right choice? Hi, I was supposed to move from Texas to Massachusetts over Christmas with my wife and 3 kids for my wife's new job (she's been working remote the past few months). We were going to drive and visit family in the Midwest along the way. Before we left Texas we were planning to quarantine for two weeks and get covid tests. Well, I freaked out because of the rising Covid cases and I think the doom and gloom of the media got to me. Will we have issues going thru certain states and have to quarantine or take tests? Will cases get so bad that borders close? We are not experienced winter drivers and I was scared of driving in winter weather, getting into an accident, and then not be able to go to a hospital because they're full. I think my parents were freaked out we'd get them sick even though we'd take all the precautions. I was also concerned we'd get to Massachusetts, schools would be remote (they're not yet for the town we are moving to, but could be after Xmas) and then we'd have two crazy kids stuck in an apartment in winter. My wife told her boss on MOnday we were still planning on moving and then I freaked out reading the news. She gave me 24 hours to make a decision. I went back and forth and suffer extreme anxiety. I thought it would be irresponsible to take three young kids across the country during winter during the height of a pandemic. My wife said we'd be fine, we'll be in our bubble in the car and what are the odds we'd have an accident. I told her Let's go and then she said are you sure and then I second guessed adn said to stay. As she was about to tell her boss we are staying I yelled out to her that I""m go and she said too late, she just sent an email. Since then I've had multiple panic attacks. I made the wrong decision. Our youngest child is a baby and since my parents won't see him at christmas that means they'll never see him as a baby, which breaks my heart. We were also planning to baptize him at this time in my hometown so that is now delayed. My older kids are very disappointed to not see their grandparents. Plus they thought they were getting two christmases, one in TX before we leave and one at my parents. I feel like I ruined their christmas. My wife is disappointed. My kids are also disappointed as they were looking forward to a Massachusetts winter and snow (and now I'm stuck with two wild kids for two weeks over Christmas break). Plus, it would've been nice to be ringing in the New Year in a new city, new adventure and kiss 2020 goodbye. And we had already said goodbye to some friends and I was mentally ready to leave. I was also reading that it is sometimes better for kids to change schools during the school year socially as everyone wants to meet the new kids, they're a celebrity, etc. I have to tell my work now, too, and they think this thing is all a joke. Some friends think I was overreacting, some think it was the right call. We would've been fine, right? We would've been doing mostly daytime driving and obviously if there was a storm we'd just wait until it passes if we could. And we'd be taking precautions regarding covid. I feel like I jacked up everyone's plans as I was scared about our drive from point A to point B.

This sub has been tremendously helpful as I'vee to grips with my anxiety during the pandemic. I have a phobia of plagues and disease, which has made this whole situation very NOT COOL. I have been browsing to see if this kind of situation had been described and addressed before, but I was unable to find anything.

I went out yesterday to have an in-person chat with a professor about a project for a local site. We had a tour of the site with a masked tour guide, which ultimately lasted for around an hour and a half. I continued interacting with the professor for a little while longer after that, so maybe 2 hours total.

Could someone help define for me the ""sustained interaction"" part of being at risk for getting COVID-19? We kept 6 feet apart, except in fleeting instances where we walked into (old historic) buildings where we were the only ones inside. We were outside for a majority of the time except for a few minutes where we were inside a visitor center. We all had masks on the whole time.

So, I just heard that Warner Bros. is releasing it's 2021 line of movies on HBO and cinemas simultaneously.

Let me tell you: One of the things I wanted to do for 2021 was to generally get back to normal, including going to the theaters. I love the theater experience, whether it'd be seeing new movies in a cool environment with friends or seeing older movies in different formats (like 35mm). Yet, this announcement is getting me freaked out. I know this was just announced, but I can't help but feel like people will go more and more to streaming simply because ""it's easier"", thus forcing more and more theaters to close. Like, you're telling me that one of the things I've been looking forward to might not even be available shortly afterwards? You mean, 3 years down the line, theaters might end up losing more and more money than they already have had this year? Why the fuck is WB even doing this if a vaccine's gonna take us back *to that normal* soon? What the fuck?

Literally when COVID's gone/a non-issue, why the hell do we *need* to keep distancing, masking and doing this dumb online shit afterwards? I fucking hate this. 

I mean, am I wrong? What should I do to calm down at this point? The vaccine news has given me the best feelings I've had in months, but now that's being threatened by news like this.

I'm 23F. I graduated from university last year and I've worked 4ish months all my life, in 2 different jobs. I was supposed to work this summer, but Covid ruined my plans. 

I've struggled with social anxiety in the past and my first jobs were a source of great anxiety for me because responsibilities and toxic environment.

Anyway, it dawned to me that I'm kind of scared of life going back to ""normal"". This whole year I've spent it at home. I've only really spoked to friends via chat apps because my good friends don't live in the same city as me. I had a short fling this summer, in between my country's lockdowns that I met on Tinder. Then my family that I live with.

I'm scared that when this is all over, I'll be so used to being at home and not having much social interaction, that when I look for a job I'll have some social anxiety breakdown. I'm scared that I've be weaker. That I'll want to go back to being home all day, ""safe"". 

I guess I'm self conscious because I haven't got lots of job experience in my life and the brief ones I had were in terrible environments. Due to covid I couldn't find anything this year.

90,"Just need to unload and vent. Hi guys, I tried to post this earlier but I don't think it went through. Like most people, I'm really getting frustrated with the pandemic. I've been extra cautious throughout these past 9 months, meaning I haven't really been anywhere besides the grocery store and a few doctors' offices for routine checkups. Being at home nearly 24/7 is driving me crazy, my family and I have very limited space so I don't have a place or room where I can bepletely alone, free from people and noise. This is the same place where I grew up, so as a child it was bearable, but not as an adult. Everyday I have to think about when to wake up, use the bathroom, use the kitchen, etc., so that I can amodate everyone's schedules/preferences. My family has been good atpromising, but there is only so much we can all do. The smallest inconveniences annoy me to no end, and I am really fed up with having to live this way. It impacts my mental health and even physical health sometimes. Luckily the living situation is changing soon, but it feels like that time can'te fast enough. I can't wait to leave this all behind and start a life somewhere else.

I have also had some problems with friends. I've had to break promises because I'm too nervous to hang out with people, and it feels exhausting to explain to them my reasons or try to get them to understand. It ends up feeling like I'm making excuses because my state doesn't have a lot of cases or restrictions pared to others). But there are so many risks I'd have to take to see my friends right now. It's not like I can walk down the street to see them, we all live far apart. I would have to take public transport (I haven't learned to drive yet) for at least an hour, usually more. I don't have a place to quarantine adequately from my family if I did get infected, and I don't think I could handle the insane amount of guilt for either getting a family member sick or getting sick myself and them having to take care of me or take me to the hospital. I feel like it would be incredibly selfish of me and burdensome for them. But still, I feel bad because I had to break my promise that I'd see my friends, and one friend in particularly really values quality time together, so I think she's upset that I let her down. I feel like I'm being too paranoid because it seems like everyone else is hanging out with their friends stress-free. 

This pandemic has been really mentally and emotionally exhausting, and this is the first time it has really been getting to me. I did feel the quarantine blues before, but always found a way out of it. I can't seem to find my way out of it this time. In the beginning, it sucked but I made the most of it. I learned new recipes and got really good at baking, took the time to write/read, play video games, spend time with sibling, etc. It has been really restoring to spend this time at home because I graduated in May and will be starting grad school in the spring, and I was fortunate enough to be able to take this time off in between. But it's getting harder and harder to appreciate the little things. 

I don't know what to do. All I can really do is wait for my living situation to change and hopefully things will get better. But these days all I want to do is mentally check out. That's hard too because of doom scrolling and the news, and it feels almost insulting to ignore what's going on in the world because there's so much and so many people need help. I really don't know what to do, but venting feels good.

93,"Covid symptoms but receiving negative test results Hi everyone,

I am looking for advice and wondering if anyone has had a similar experience.

Back in early March I experienced typical covid symptoms, most notably pain and pressure in my chest, lost of taste and smell, and a low-grade fever that persisted for a whole month. During that time, I took one saliva test near the onset of symptoms, and then a nasopharyngeal swab (deep nasal) a week and a half later. Both tests came back negative. However, my doctor and I are both convinced I had it based on symptoms.

Since then I had not been able to get back to feeling like myself - terrible fatigue, headaches and shortness of breath almost daily.

I know that I was recently exposed to someone at work who has tested positive around Nov 23. I was around her the day before she developed symptoms.

Now, beginning two days ago, I am sick again with the same symptoms I experienced back in March, only slightly less severe. I took a saliva test on the first day of symptoms, and the test came back negative. 

Important to note that both times this has happened, my husband has been slightly sick at the same time, but with mild cold symptoms that passed quickly.

I am trying to figure out why my tests keeping back negative. This is causing me emotional distress not knowing for sure what is wrong. I feel very strongly that I have covid, so these tests are totally invalidating and upsetting.

My doctor again believes that I have it based on symptoms. I have a nasopharyngeal test scheduled for next week, and they are referring me to a University study for covid long-haulers. The fact that my doctor believes it is covid has helped me not feel so crazy.

Has anyone had a similar experience with negative tests? I am also curious if anyone has any advice regarding testing, or insight into what is happening to me.

I’m still afraid though. I’m afraid of dying. My mom died last December. December 21 to be exact. She was 57, and I’m not sure if that’s messing with my head. Within the last month I have been taking more Vit D and a daily vitamin, and I have been walking at least 35-40 min a day, and closing my rings on my Apple Watch. 

It doesn’t mean I’m not afraid though. I have seen posts on here though about others who are overweight, and scared. I’m one of them. I really just wanted to rant, and post about my feelings. I of course self monitor, but I also am so close to it, the thought gets stuck in my brain. 

I know anxiety doesn’t help it. I know it can play tricks on my brain, oh what’s this or that, etc. I appreciate you all reading my thoughts, and I hope everyone stays safe and happy.",27,0.97,k5ltza,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k5ltza/my_wife_is_an_icu_nurse_in_a_covid_unit/,5,Support,2020-12-03,-8,88,-0.09090909090909091
103,"Not doing too well Damn I am really struggling with the lockdown. I had never used drugs by myself daily until COVID hit in March, I got a bit depressed and started the habit of doing cocaine + Ketamine basically every night for 3 months. That went on and was really messing me up, but luckily I got out of town for a bit, helped me see the light and I stopped. Where I’m living right now, summer didn’t really have too many restrictions, so I almost had my life back and I was in a really good place. I was healthy, off drugs, excited about the future.

Now, for the last two months, I’ve barely left my house and have just been taking down stupid amounts of Cocaine Ketamine and Alcohol. I need to stop, I know I need to stop, but I can’t. I’m incredibly depressed, have zero motivation to do anything except for drugs, and yeah everything is just really rough. I basically wake up, get depressed, then try to drown my depression in alcohol in the morning, and move on to some Coke + Ket. I have friends who care and know that I’m down and want to help, but I can’t remove my own negativity. I can’t go to the gym, which always helped me get better in the past. It’s cold af here and I just can’t motivate myself to do anything. So I’m just eating dirty food, doing drugs, watching TV, and just being fucking useless and sad. To think that just 3 months ago, I was healthy, cooking every day, happy, reading books. I know I can do it, I just can’t MAKE myself do it. I’m like stuck in a loop.

And now I’m realizing that this going to go on for another year. Like I thought that the vaccine would be here in January, and BAM, back to normal. But I read some articles that have made me feel even more hopeless. No, we’re going to have to deal with this until we reach herd immunity, 60-70% of the FUCKING POPULATION. Damn, I really don’t know if I’m going to make it. Not going to hurt myself because it would make my mom too sad, but fuck, I’m going toe out of this a full blown depressed drug addict FUCKKKKKKK. And I feel the government doesn’t understand the impact that their having on me, like I UNDERSTAND COVID IS BAD AND KILLS PEOPLE, but I really don’t know if I’m going to recover, so is it okay that it’s going to kill me? Fuck man. I’m sorry for the brain fart, I just have no one to talk to about this, none of my friends know of the extent to which im abusing drugs right now, and they don’t understand how fucked up my brain is. And I can’t stop.

What’s the best way to get help? Go to a drug counselor? I feel like I’ll see them and I’ll just keep on using drugs. Damn I feel quite hopeless right now. I haven’t smiled in weeks. Writing this made me feel a tiny bit better.

104,"Struggling With The Fear Of Making My Father Lose Work If I Test Positive I had runny nose yesterday and wanted to get tested. I often get a runny nose from dust allergies. However, this seemed worse than usual so I wanted to get tested. I have not been outside my home in almost two weeks as I was laid off. If I have covid I was either exposed on my last day of work or someone in my household has an asymptomatic case. 

I ended up getting into a huge fight with my parents because my father will be forced to stay home from work if I test positive. If my father loses 2 weeks of pay we will not be able to pay the bills this month. 

My parents also do not believe that covid is a dangerous virus. They think it is all overblown. I am constantly worried about my father because he is in ill health and at risk of developingplications. He has a chronic cough for over a year (pre-covid). He refused to see a doctor before the pandemic about this chronic cough. 
He was sick to his stomach for days last week and blamed it on food poisoning. He will not get tested because he is afraid of losing pay and doesn't believe the tests are at all accurate. People at his work have tested positive but they worked in a different department so he was not required to get tested.

I am supposed to return to work on Tuesday (I was temporarily laid off). I wanted this test because I don't want to put others I work with at risk.
However, if I am forced to stay home I will also lose pay for two weeks. 
We really need the money. My father and I are the only people working in a 4 person household. 
We could afford the loss of my job (its minimum wage) but not my father's. 
I haven't gotten the test yet.

106,"Not only is my older brother sick, but so is my mom now as well. A few days ago I said my brother is sick, well so is my mother now. I can't afford to move out right now unless I want to be homeless, so I'm basically stuck here. Also here's a bit of info, my older brother lives downstairs while I live upstairs, my mother on the other hand lives upstairs with me, she's literally in the very next room across from mine.

Also if anyone is wondering, yes I care about my mother, even if we weren't in a pandemic I would still hope she's ok, but because we are in a pandemic it's not just her health at stake, it's mine as well, and she's literally doing nothing to protect me, literally nothing.

Someone posted that the death rate is low, and that's good, but I still don't want to be a Covid survivor, I don't want to catch it at all, and the reason is because I don't want the permanent health problems that cane with catching it. As I said in the other post, I'm only in my early 20s so far, I haven't gotten to enjoy life yet, and I don't want my body to get screwed up before I get to do the things I want to do. This is so messed up.

I wish I could travel to the future, get vaccinated, and thene back, and no longer have to worry about others putting me in danger. Unfortunately time travel doesn't exist. All I can do is hope I get lucky, and somehow avoid catching it until the vaccinees out, and I can finally take it and put an end to this nightmare.

Also as I said in the other post, my brother hasn't gotten tested even though he's sick, and now my mother also doesn't want to get tested either, so I don't even know if they have the virus or not.

I'm also scared for my mother as well as myself, she's in her 50s, and she's overweight, and has tons of health problems already. Even though I don't like her, I still care about her, I hope she doesn't die, and I hope it doesn't mess her up.

108,"My boyfriend’s work may not let him quarantine This past week I’ve been exposed to two COVID-19 positive people at my work and potentially more. I also have been showing symptoms but got tested and it came back negative. The doctor I went to said that it could potentially be too early to catch, a false negative, or some other virus but that I need to self isolate and that anyone else I live with should as well. My work had no issue accepting the news but my boyfriend’s work seems to be having trouble understanding the situation. They basically told him that “that’s what all doctors are going to say” and that they want him toe in to get tested at the pop up location at his work. So he agrees toe in. However, when he went to get tested the people at the pop up location pretty much scolded him and told him that he should have gone to their clinic instead and that he needs to start self isolating. They did a send off test and let him know that they would be contacting his employer so he can start isolating. He went home and thought that would be it. 

A few hours after he got home, we hadn’t heard anything from his work so he calls and talks to the store manager. He explains what’s going on, what both doctors said, and what he’s told the other managers so far. His store manager’s response? “So basically you just want tomorrow off, right?” After that they said that he can stay home until he gets his results back since he’s so worried but that he should pretty much expect toe back to work after that. 

Y’all I’m livid. He works in a restaurant and they’re not taking this seriously. I could maybe understand him going back right away if I wasn’t showing symptoms and if I wasn’t sick but I am. It seems to me that they think he just wants an excuse for time off but he isn’t like that. Plus I work vet med so social distancing at my work is pretty much nonexistent. 

Is there anything anyone can rmend that we tell his work to help them understand the situation a bit better? Can his employer even decline his request to self isolate if a doctor is giving him a note and telling him to?

110,"Not having easy time with Corona this winter >< Hey guys, I am new here.

**This November has been really really really hard for me! Just came here for a bit of support.**

I live with my boyfriend in a studio flat. Very small space, very little privacy. No doors. 

Because of that alone, I had such a big meldwon in the middle of November. I could not take it anymore: hearing him or his colleagues talking. I called his HR and said they have to hire him an office or let him into their office, because it can't go on like this.

They agreed that he goes to the office. Their office is huge, and he and a couple more of his colleagues (who has similar situation at home) are working there very far away from each other. **With all safety measures.**

That actually was a huge help. That alone gave me so much peace.

However, I had a family issue, that I couldn't help with: my aunt went insane. Turns out she has Schizophrenia, was not taking her pills, decided to sell her house and was calling me about it and being extremely aggressive to me, wanting me to help her! (We live in different countries and barely ever talk to each other). She harassed me so bad I had terrible panic attacks. Then I learned about her condition and stop contact with her.

&#x200B;

That took a big hit on me, for two weeks I was very unstable, really fucked up my trust in people. Because she really did a number on me, manipulating and lying.

&#x200B;

On top of that my boyfriend has a big trauma from his childhood that he started dealing with, and he was hitting a difficult place in his therapy, where he was processing anger and admitting his trauma. So i needed to be really patient and loving and understanding with him. Because of all the heavy emotions in his therapy, he could not also work, so he is having a burn out. So I had to be really caring.

&#x200B;

On top of that, I was stripped off my support system. My best friend got a girlfriend and has barely any time or headspace to talk to me, my other close friend got herself a boyfriend too, which made her very unavailable. So I did not know where to get help and someone to talk to and that made feel really isolated.

&#x200B;

Also, I had some challenges at work, because Covid.

But this is already a lot and if you read, thank you <3

So this was my November. How was yours?

You know the hardest part was losing my friends, because I really miss them and I know that they can't help it, because of chemistry in your brain, you just want to be with your partner the first months. But I really did not see thating and was not prepared to be SO ALONE. They just don't have time for me and that really hurts. I guess that's why I am here.

111,"I'm worried and conflicted. What if the vaccine doesn't work? Hello. I wanted to post this question on other COVID subreddits but I could only upload videos or sources so I wanted to ask here. I'm sorry if this isn't allowed but I do have genuine anxiety and worry over this.

With news of the new vaccine about to start rolling out I have trust issues with it. I wonder if it does or doesn't work? Will those who were fine get infected if the vaccine fails? What if the doctors and nurses who will understandably and rightfully get it first get sick and cannot work and treat other COVID cases? What if I refuse it out of fear? Could I get it later if it's proven safe?

I've been inside, alone, and distant since May. I have daily and household needs and items delivered to avoid going into any store or public place. I carry a mask, gloves and sanitizer for anything I do when I leave the house. I'm in the demographic where I ""should"" be ""ok"" if I happen to get it but even with a cold or flu I get knocked on my butt and bedridden for a while.

113,"I really don't know how I'm going to get through Christmas this year As some background; I'm not the biggest fan of Christmas. 

I am part of a family that tends to bicker a lot when we get together (especially around the holidays) so I never really enjoy December 25th. My favourite part of Christmas is usually going to see my friends at the pub but we can't do that this year because of Covid. I also usually travel to stay with a close friend at New Year's and I won't be able to do that either.

As well as that, my brother and his three kids will be at our house and I'm nervous of potentially catching coronavirus off one of the children (my parents are CONVINCED for some reason that kids can't spread the virus so they are unconvinced).

Work also gets very busy around Christmas and not being in the office this year will make it very difficult in terms of tying up loose ends and getting everything done on time.

To top it all off, my girlfriend lives with her friend (let's call him Jack). Neither she nor Jack can go home for Christmas this year due to Covid-19 so they were just going to spend it in the house on their own.

Jack has a friend called Matt. Matt and my girlfriend very briefly dated before she and I ever met but then decided they were better off as friends - they're not VERY close but they are still pals.

Matt can't go home for Christmas either so he invited Daniel and my girlfriend around to his house to spend it with him and his housemates just to have dinner, play Dungeons & Dragons and drink (I think there'll be at least six people there).

I can't help but feel a little bit intimidated by Matt and somewhat ufortable with this.

My girlfriend said she wouldpletely understand if I didn't want her to go but I don't want her to miss out on a fun Christmas with friends either (and I know she really gets along with a lot of the people living in that house).

Overall, I just feel a little bit overwhelmed by Christmas 2020 in general.

I think it's going to be a huge challenge for me mentally and I'm not sure how to prepare for it. I also feel guiltyplaining because I know there's people who are much worse off than I am (who lost jobs and such).

117,"Quit volunteer Covid position, feeling guilty I work as a developer in IT at a healthcare corporation and have been working from home for the last 9 months. My anxiety has been ramping up more and more lately, and has developed into having occassional panic attacks. Last week I was asked by the higher ups to volunteer full time to help at the covid testing sites and was told about the different roles.

At the time, I thought that it would be beneficial to get out of the house and do something that could benefit people, since I've been feeling somewhat guilty about sitting around doing office work while others are putting their lived at risk. So I agreed.

I recieved no more information until sunday due to Thanksgiving and didnt recieve a schedule until monday night. I got an hour of online video training and got fit tested for an N95 mask. Yesterday I went and did the full day. I was expecting to be doing registration or traffic control, as I had been told a few months ago that only nurses could do swabbing. Instead they had me doing swabbing all day.
Honestly, I was fine most of the day. But when I got home I absolutely freaked out and had a panic attack. I didnt want to get my family sick.

So I called them and told them I couldn't do it, and let them know I wouldn't being in for the rest of the week. They seemed understanding, but I felt awful for abandoning the team. They had provided plenty of PPE. I felt like a total failure for not being able to do this.

118,"I am so tired of worrying Every tightness I feel in my chest, every cough, every body ache, sends me into a panic. 

It's been like this since March and I'm actually exhausted. 

I'm a college student living at home with my parents and high risk sibling. They've made it clear to me - if anyone gets sick, it's my fault. If anyone dies from this, it's my fault. I would have to live with guilt for the rest of my life. 

I get where they'reing from. I love my family and I do everything I can to keep them safe.

The thing is - I rarely go out.

I'm a full time student, unemployed, and the only time I leave the house is to get groceries with my parents and just recently - a visit to offer support to a friend who attempted to take their life days prior. (Side note: They tested negative 2 days before I visited as it's mandatory for their work. We took all precautions as well. They just needed someone to be there with them.)

I want to keep everyone safe and healthy - family and strangers alike. I try to be as safe as I possibly can be. I always wear a mask, gloves, eye protection, use hand sanitizer, social distance, you name it.  Yet I still feel like I can get this stupid virus and pass it on to the people I love most. It scares the shit out of me.

This whole situation hurts. Seeing friends and family and so many others fall ill and in some cases pass when all of this could have been mitigated so long ago... I don't know whether to be infuriated or horrified. Maybe it's both. 

I just don't want to be in this constant state of fear anymore. I hate going to bed and waking up scared. My allergies feel like a death sentence. Guilt and fear is ravaging my already stressed out body and mind, I can't keep up with academics, I can barely focus on anything... This feels like the worst burn out I have ever experienced but so so so much worse. 

At this point I dont even know what to do anymore. 

It feels good to type this all out though. That's some progress at least. Things will get better with time, everything does.

119,"Is everyone else doing horribly in their college courses?? Hey, so I actually came into subreddit with a similar problem to some threads I have seen posted. Today was the first day that I have seen threads about people performing subpar in college courses this semester. I have been looking for the past few weeks occasionally. Not sure if I am looking for advice or to see if I am a small minority having this problem or what.

I am in my later years of undergraduate chemistry and I am having a horrible semester. I just now kinda of realized/noticed how much of a hole I dug myself into and I have no idea if I can get out. I am really sad that this could actually influence my graduate school/medical school applications and I didn't know if other people were ACTUALLY failing or if it just that I have dropped the ball and failed myself this semester. On twitter, I see all these viral tweets about people ""failing"" this semester but I wasn't sure if it was serious or if people are just being extra. I feel like if many people are failing, why are professors still giving us this insane work load/harder exams that are proctored. Every exam for my science courses have been ""harder than any exam in previous semesters"" according to local tutors and students that have taken the course before. I have not shown up to my ""optional"" attendance courses in over a month and a half. It is not because I am saying ""fuck it, I'll just read the notes,"" it is because I actually can not get myself to sit through it and attend to be stressed out. 

My course load is somewhat difficult, but I have had harder and been occupied with other things in other semesters but I seem to be doing the worst in this one than any other semester I have been through. I have a pretty decent amount of money saved up and my parents make good money, so I am not working at the moment as I do not want COVID, but I have been frugal because I do not want to spend my money, but I really wanna go to therapy or something, and I do not want to ask my parents for money if I run dry.

I spend about 4 hours in bed every morning struggling to get up and about 3 more at night struggling to go to sleep. In between the day I either waste time or all the studying I do goes in one ear and goes out the other. I am still smiling and laughing and talking to friends on discord, exercising almost everyday but shit just isn't right and I am overall doing very bad. 

To add onto the stress, I have had very up semesters and some ""C's"" semesters where my GPA is about 2.6 or a 2.7, I don't even remember at this point and I don't want to check it. I am at the point where, if I would've kept my upwards trend, I could've ended with a nice 3.0 to 3.3. But this semester really fucked everything up and I don't even know if I can get around a 3.00... I am scared to email my professors asking if I could have a last chance on the final ( I have about 10-14 days to grind all my course materials) to do well on the exam to at least pass my courses. I don't know what I would even say, I feel like my professors would think I am just dropping excuses. 


The only positive that has really happened recently is that I cried to my parents and told them everything and they were very supportive and just told me to finish off as best I can but I don't want to fall behind anymore than I have to, I am already a year behind since I switched to chemistry :( I keepparing myself to my other peers and the years that they have or will graduate in.


I honestly like online courses, its just the lack of going to study at starbucks, the library or in study groups and going out at the end of the week that really has taken a toll on me. I think school is what is making things a thousand times worst for me right now.

120,"between my LDR, cancelled plans, and tinnitus acting up, idk how much more of this I can handle. My girlfriend lives in Malaysia, and I'm in the States. I was supposed to be moving over to be with her in May, but obviously that wasn't able to happen. Now it looks like it could be May of 2021 before I'm able to be back with her. I know this doesn't seem like all that big of a deal, but she's literally the only person in the world that I'm close to. It's hard being so far apart and being on such dramatically different time zones. There are only 4 or 5 hours each day where we are both up so it's hard to even talk to her. I miss her so deeply, and I worry she is drifting. I hate that this whole thing could wind up costing me the love of my life. 

&#x200B;

In addition to that, I had planned to travel to Bali this weekend to hang out until I'm able to get back to Malaysia. I got the special visa and everything I need to go and stay for up to 6 months. But the closer my departure date gets, the worse I feel about going. I just can't imagine spending 2 days in transit with covid cases as high as they are. I'm 30 and otherwise very healthy, but I fear I'd lose my sense of taste and smell if I got covid, and that would drive me absolutely mad. One of the things I enjoy most about travel is eating local food, and not being able to taste would just make me so very depressed. If I never got it back I'd probably not want to live anymore. So it just doesn't seem worth the risk to go. (for the record, I was planning to quarantine in Jakarta two weeks and get a negative test before flying to Bali, even though neither are required. I'd never want to put locals at risk). 

&#x200B;

The primary reason I was wanting to go to Bali in the first place was that being locked away in my home has made me extremely depressed and suicidal, mostly because now I have no distraction from my tinnitus (constant ringing in the ear). When I'm traveling I don't notice it as much, and it doesn't bother me that much. But when I'm home, it's all I can focus on and it gets me extremely depressed. I know going off would ordinarily help, but I just can't help thinking it would do more harm than good this time because I'd likely contract covid on the journey over. Then I'd have a whole new set of worries. 

&#x200B;

I want to hold out for the vaccine and go once I'm able to get it, but I don't even know if I'll be willing to get it once its available out of fear that it may make my tinnitus worse somehow. And I don't even know if I'll make it until April when the vaccine will likely be available to young, healthy people. I just feel like I'm never going to be able to get out of here. I feel the walls closing in. 

&#x200B;

I know my problems seem rather trivial inparison to lots of other people who have lost loved ones, their careers, their life savings etc. I hope my post does note off as insensitive to these people. Truly,  my heart goes out to each and every person that has been affected by this horrible virus. If I had people in my life to talk to about this, I would discuss it with them rather than posting about it, but I genuinely don't have anyone.",2,1,k5eivh,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k5eivh/between_my_ldr_cancelled_plans_and_tinnitus/,2,Support,2020-12-03,-21,151,-0.1390728476821192
121,"Being ignored during pandemic I just wanted to vent I guess since no one in my life is available to listen. I'm a 33 y/o bipolar guy with a long history of losing friends due to being difficult to handle and I thought the remaining friends I had left were solid, but the pandemic proved to me again that I was wrong. I think I might possibly be on the spectrum as well but never been diagnosed but suffice to say that I have extreme issues with socializing and connecting with people.

I'm being ghosted by ALL of my friends since March and I think what I've realized is that these people only tolerate me during simple times but during hard times such as this I'm just too much. I've tried so hard to be easier to be friends with but honestly at this point in my life I think it's a lost cause. It hurts so much to understand how much these people mean to me and how little I mean to them. I've always been a peripheral friend but I just want to be loved. Humans are meant to be social and my dream since I was a child was simply to feel like I belong somewhere but I just can't find acceptance anywhere. Hell, I even remember back in pre-school I hid in the corner away from all of the other kids. Looking back.. that was definitely a warning sign for things toe. 

Honestly? I don't think I can live with these feelings for much longer. It's too painful. I fantasize about ending it every day but I'm too afraid to actually kill myself.

I know I won't kill myself, only because I fear of how my family and friends will react, but if it weren't for that, I might have done it already. I've been depressed due to lockdown, I'm a person that loves going out, meeting people, and interacting with them. People tell me to ""Get used to it"" but I just can't.

131,"COVID Struggles With my Roommate- Can Anyone Relate? I was hoping to get some advice on my current roommate struggles. I live with two other females (mid-20's) one of them moved in a few months ago and is super respectful & understanding. My other roommate, who I've now lived with for 2 years, has always been messy, at times disrespectful, and overall, stressful. However, I've respected her lifestyle up until COVID hit.

Since the early summer, she's been treating COVID as if it doesn't apply to her. During COVID (especially recently), she has snuck out during April quarantine to meet up with a guy (& told us about it months later), hung out with 20+ people at a time, frequently goes to restaurants, has brought guys over to the apt that I don't know (one of which was drunk & walked into my room, and later urinated all over the bathroom floor), doesn't clean, and has already had two COVID scares as a result from hanging out with groups of people.

I've spoken to her four times about COVID safety, social distancing, and overall, how ufortable I feel in our living space. The only thing that's changed, is she stops telling me about her weekend social outings (mostly b/c I've stopped asking) and she stopped posting her outings on social media. My anxiety and stress is at an all time high.

132,"A French perspective ; how I cope with Covid-19 Hi.

I live in South of France and I want to share my experience.

First off, I'm fine. I actually want to help by sharing. Lockdowns are probably easier for me than other people, because I'm used to live alone and not going out much. Sometimes people tell this to me in almost an accusative tone, like it's unfair. It is unfair, but it's not my fault. For the first time in my life, I'm glad I'm an introvert.

Yet I'm a human being and I miss my friends. I used to go out maybe once a month, to play board games and have fun. I have two very important friends that I almost never see (one of them became my GF), and 5-6 friends that I like to play with but without this deep bonding unfortunately.

They suggested me some hangouts between lockdowns. I refused, even though I miss them. A few months later, I learned that she and her BF were positive. It makes me sound responsible. But you have to understand I'm not responsible because they became positive ; I'm responsible because I didn't take any chances, no matter whates next. I think it's an important concept. If you take risks and don't get Covid, it doesn't mean you were right. It just mean you were lucky, but it's doesn't justify anything. If you stay safe and get unlucky, at least you'll have no regrets. You did your best.

So I hadn't much trouble locking myself down, even between lockdowns. I still went out doing some bicycle (when I had the right to), and I'm glad to say this : you can do bicycle with a mask. It's possible. It's not pleasant, but it's not a torture, and still better than staying inside (if you have the right to do it, of course). Yet I saw like 10% of people wearing a mask doing sports. I actually counted, sitting on a bench. You just have to take it easy. If you go for a mad sprint, either running of cycling, you will have trouble breathing with mask. So just do it in a chill pace, and you'll be able to keep your mask and be safer. Also, the more intense the effort, and the more you'll breathe in and out and increase the risk.

My family is crazy. We are currently in second lockdown and she takes walks  without masks with my uncle and aunt, who took the car toe at our place. They don't even have the right to take a walk not alone. I told her everything I wanted to say, which you can imagine. She replied ""Well, this is our place, and we'll do what we want. I'm taking the right"". This is the 4th time they broke lockdown, and we still have 15 days to go. That was the initial motivation for this post. 

Now, how do I keep myself busy ? Pretty much exactly like usual with my unemployment. I hate being useless, but I have to recognize I unwillingly trained for this. I love to learn things. The best advice for me is that when I'm focused on something, I cannot think about Covid. It's ok to check the news because we want to know what's going on, but there is not much breaking news on a daily basis. You'll probably hear the important stuff from your friends and family anyways. Maybe 5mn a day if you really want to not miss any mandatory stuff on your local policy, but the rest of the day, your job is to think about something else and relax. Most of us can't do anything about what's going on except staying safe, so you might as well take care of yourself and your sanity.

So, what I do is talk to my friends on a daily basis. We have discord and even if we don't play or anything, and we don't see each other IRL, it's very important to me to have this basic social interaction and hear their voices. As long as I'll have them, I know I'll never go crazy.

About learning stuff : I learned Riichi Mahjong. This definitely kept me busy. More than busy, it melted my brain because this game has 42 winning hands (Poker but alien version basically) and the scoring system is insane. Good thing is, when you play online you don't have to worry about it. Here is the platform [ I played like 100 games and I'm still discovering the game. I rmend chess too. Learning deep strategy games can use a lot of your time, and that's perfect. Rubik's cube is also a great pick.

I've read A popular history of United States. I've been hooked every single of the 800 pages. Netflix helps a lot too. Don't be too picky. You can't affort it right now. It's better to be busy than bing a bored cinema critique. Check out Nanowrimo, a writingmunity. It's a November event, but you can find spreadsheets to challenge yourself whenever you want. [Scribook]( is amazing too. I also learned juggling. It's so much more physical than I thought. 30mn juggling is enough to spend myself. [ is a great reference.

There are autumn sales on Steam right now. I hate buying games, (I hate buying anything) but what we can't afford is stare at a wall and get depressed.

But really, pick any subject that you like and dive into it. Books, history, science, whatever fills your brain with something else than Covid. What you learn will end up being useful somehow.

My big mistake during this second lockdown is not doing sports. During the first, I was running inside my flat. It's ridiculous but it's not stupid if this works. It's still running. You can do a lot of sports without any equipments. A one-minute plank is a lot of energy spent and all muscles involved. Pushups, squats, lunges, pretty much all yoga and stretching exercises. When I don't use my body at all, I feel nervous and frustrated. Now I got headaches and my digestion is bad. No wonder.

TLDR : Talk to your friends on phone/Discord even you can't meet them IRL, it's better than nothing. Do sports inside if you can't go outside, your body will thank you (and it improves your immune system, which is a big deal right now, but it doesn't mean you can take more risks of course). And learn something and focus as much as you can to think about something else than Covid. Games, movies, books are great too, whatever keeps your mind busy.

I've been fully isolating (I'm immunosuppressed) and this experience is the only interaction I've had with anyone aside from my spouse in over a month.

I'm fully aware that this might sound crazy, and people might tell me I'mpletely overreacting. But I've been talking myself in circles so I need some outside perspective. I lurk here a bit under my real account but am using a throwaway for this post.

Last night around 8pm I had to give something to someone in my town. He came to my door (which is outside, no enclosed porch or anything, just an open awning) and knocked, standing outside my door. He was wearing a mask and as far as I know not COVID positive and wasn't displaying any symptoms I could see/hear. I asked him to move back from the door (4 ft to the top of the stairs) and then walk down the 8 steps from the landing (again this is all outside) to the ground level. He did so, so he was then standing around 12-15 ish feet away from my door: 4 ft to the steps, and then 8-10 ft down the steps. [Keep in mind that he stood on my landing for a few minutes before I came to the door.] Then (I'm still inside my house) I opened the door about 6-8 inches, quickly threw the item out the door, and closed the door. The door was open for maybe 5-8 seconds. Stupidly I was NOT wearing a mask. I was inside my house and got flustered.

Does anyone have a sense for the likelihood of having been infected?

I've been obsessing about this all day. Maybe this sounds crazy... but I'm terrified. I'm immunpromised and my outlook would be pretty bleak if I got it.

I work in NYC at a construction managementpany with about 8 other people. Today, one of my coworkers had a meeting with our boss, the CEO, informing him that he just found out today that his daughter has tested positive for covid. Now, there's no way I would have found this out unless said coworker told me directly because when he informed our boss, he literally told my coworker ""**don't tell anybody**"". He did not mention it during our Zoom meeting today, nor do I expect him to, period. My question is- how can I report this kind of situation, and is there anything at all that I can do to protect myself? My plan is to work from home until I get a negative test result back.

* I'll grab beer with my pod (group of friends dedicated to same precautions) and inform the group if they visit friends outside the pod
* Communication profile preference is ""influencer""
* I'm a people pleaser to a fault

My dad:

* 3/10 on how precautious he is about covid.
   * Reason for this rating: while he wears a mask when I'm around him in outdoor settings his mask slipped off his nose in my house and I've been scared ever since.
   * Has madements that Covid is a hoax
   * Is still dating and seeing people (guessing that the maskse off)

* I believe our other family members will be cautious enough to meet our newborn, but I'm very interested in hearing ideas on how to ensure the correctmunication with them to enable a safe visit.

145,"COVID has put a huge roadblock on bing a full-on adult **Tl;dr:** Life has relentless on letting me actually be an adult for various personal reasons. Trying to make lemonade out of lemons, so my *question* is: what can I learn online or on my own to a somewhat successful adult when life goes back to some sort of ""normal""? 

\-

First, **backstory**: to make a long story short: the last 5 years since I graduated from college has SUCKED. I decided to take a year off after college to just work in customer service since I had been in some type of schooling from age 2 to age 24. A year after I graduated, I got incredibly sick with something called Guillain-Barré syndrome. It took me \~2 years to walk again and to function. I was then overly dramatic and moved across the ocean to finish graduate school, and lived there for 1.5 years. 

I graduated with my MA in late December 2019. Decided to take a few months off before job hunting, since I didn't really get a break from school at all for close to a year. The plan was to live at home for \~1 year until I find a job, and then move wherever (preferably with public transportation, because GBS left me with bilateral foot drop which makes it impossible to drive a car). Like, I don't even have an actual room in this house; we literally put my bed from storage into the office. 

Annnnnnnnnd then COVID happened.

Needless to say, I am stuck in this office space for a bedroom for the unforeseeable future. I am useful to my parents because I help take care of my autistic brother, and also I'm sort of terrified to get COVID, so leaving the house (to go into indoor public places that is) doesn't happen often. 

But I feel like I haven't learned that many useful things in the past year that will allow me to survive better as an adult once all of this is over (or at least until it gets manageable, I guess?). 

At the most, I guess that I learned how to use an air fryer, and learned how to make homemade pizza dough? And that I have no business trying to make my own bread. Unless its an Easter Bread. THAT turned out awesome. 

Anyways! **My question for you all is:** what can I do, at home obviously, to be a better independent adult or just overall person? What should I learn or practice? What do you wish you knew how to do or what do you wish you knew how it worked before being an awesome independent adult?

150,"Is there such thing as too many vitamins? I was potentially (small chance) exposed Tuesday of last week, so almost a week ago. I started having symptoms on Thursday night but didn’t know if the exhaustion was Covid or from working non stop Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday preparing for Thanksgiving. Either way, I decided to stay in my room the whole weekend as my exhaustion came and went, leaving my room only with a mask on. For the past 4-5 days, I’ve been taking 2000-3000 IU of Vitamin D, 500 mg of Vitamin C + a packet of Emergen-C, and 23.9 mg of Zinc. Yesterday I picked up some zinc lozenges as my throat started feeling scratchy, and those contain an extra 5 mg of Zinc. 

I’ve just noticed the past few days that after I take all the vitamins (typically together after dinner) that’s when nausea kicks in. I thought maybe it’s a Covid symptom but today after having a few of the lozenges back to back, I got REALLY nauseous. To the point where I feel like I need to throw up, but I won’t because I have a phobia of puking (that’s a whole other story)... Also I did take Tylenol a couple hours prior to taking the vitamins/lozenges for a headache... don’t know if that would have any weird interaction? 

My question is, does this amount of vitamins seem like an overkill and the possible reason for feeling so nauseous or is it an acceptable amount when fighting a possible cold/flu? I saw people taking 5000 IU of vitamin D and zinc/vitamin C supplements so I didn’t think anything of it.

My partner's coping mechanism is to avoid talking about it, to pretend it isn't happening, to keep it all inside.

I moved to a new town in a new state, living alone in an apartment with no pets because I know I won't have time for pets when the world is normal.

I've been slacking terribly and haven't touched all my lengthy assignments that are due soon.

In these months I’ve never even gotten deliveries, when I saw the world starting to crumble I got mostly canned Goods to last me a long time, I have enough still for maybe 3 or 4 more months.

My question is that I’m starting to see more and more people outside, and while they wear masks they do seem to be leaving home more and more for leisure and not just for work, which to me feels dangerous. I’m not gonna reveal my location but in my county there’s still dozens of daily cases, and just yesterday three more needless deaths.

My point is that I may be mid to low risk for spreading COVID for having isolated so long, but I’m not sure. There’s also long term COVID which I guess could be a possibility since while I’m asymptomatic I could still be a spreader. I'm generally healthy and under 30 but with these virus that goes down the drain it means nothing...

I'm living with my immunoconpromised partner and a couple roommates who do essential jobs (separate rooms).  As such, i've been going really hard with the social distancing, masking, endless sanitizing, and developing my art practice to generate ie, ALL at home.  I've got savings and a degree (just finished), but the job market is slammed and I dont have a car, and student loan payments start next month.  We've made it this far, but I'm worried that this current path isnt going to be sustainable for very long.  Rent and food arent cheap, and neither is my partners medication. Thanks american healthcare system for making the only decent inhaler $400/mo. And my business isnt especially booming T_T

Gonna be real, the despair is hitting hard these days.  My roommates dont understand how being immunpromised works and arent as cautious as they could be on social distancing stuff.  I need something to look forward to or work towards because the constant reminders that thousands of people are dying and millions are sick are not helping me get thru the day.  Neither is people spitting at me for ""looking Chinese"" and ""bringing the virus"" while im out in a mask.

This one is for the doctors/scientists/public health folks out there:  what is a realistic estimate for when people like me, who live close to at risk individuals-- when will we be able to safely traverse the outside without the constant fear of covid19ing thru to end us/maim us?  When can I ride a bus or train again and not fear for my life?  When will I be able to go to a friends house and leave this accursed apartment without quarantining for two weeks?  At what point will I be able to attain currency in public so i can keep clinging to life in this capitalist hellhole? When will my friends go to work and not worry that they'll go home to kill/maim their families?  I know the vaccines areing, but those arent enough, and the holiday induced covid waves make progress seem hopeless.  

I'm not looking for a back to normal, just looking for a timeline for a halfway manageable/reasonable quality of life wherein I am not eternally locked up in this apartment.

I've heard a lot of predictions for how this pandemic will shape human behavior after people are vaccinated and restrictions are lifted around next summer.

163,"Would like some thoughts on Christmas travel plans. Hello all.  Was looking for some thoughts on a trip we are tentatively planning over Christmas break (myself, my wife and two kids).  

Our plans are to take a road trip from Arkansas to Los Angeles. We will stay on Airbnb’s in Lubbock and Tuscon on the way there.  We will wipe down the Airbnb’s when we get there and will only be eating drive thru or curbside pick up.  We will have a cooler in the car with drinks/snacks to limit convenience store stops.  We will be visiting my wife’s grandparents on Christmas morning, but plan to see them only outside and for a couple hours, and will only go in their house to use the restroom.  Once in LA, we will be staying in an Airbnb with a large backyard area, and will only be seeing my sister in law and her fiancé all outside.  Again, only eating takeout.  Other than that we will spend some time at the beach, distanced from others of course (I miss surfing and think getting in the water will do wonders for my mental health).  On the way home, Airbnb’s again and on my takeout.  

What are everyone’s thoughts on this plan? I should mention that if we skip the trip, I will be working and while my exposure is somewhat limited at work, it would likely be equal or slightly greater while at work than when on this trip.",2,0.75,k3or63,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k3or63/would_like_some_thoughts_on_christmas_travel_plans/,10,Questions,2020-11-30,-3,76,-0.039473684210526314
165,"Oddly specific, but how dangerous is a sink basin? So this is kind of oddly specific, but it has been the source of a lot of really distressing cleaning cycles for me. Because of how the sinks in my house are designed they tend to have a significant amount of backsplash, the result is that I'll end up getting water that hit the basin and splashed back up onto my arms. This leads to me feeling the need to rewash wherever was just hit by the water, which can get really awkward/messy when I get splashed on the elbow or something.

Along similar lines is that my family manages to get water on the floor every time they was their hands in the kitchen. This normally wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that I know some of the water drops that inevitably gets absorbed into my socks are from rinsed hands rather than washed. Which means I end up going through my socks like mad and having to do laundry way more often than I should.

Everyone there was wearing a mask but the place didn't have much air flow, and I had to take off the mask for some time because of the requirements of the project. No one took the mask at the same time that I did and they were not constantly near me. I am so worried and since I went there I am having anxiety attacks non stop. I felt a weird sensation in my throat that I dont know if is allergies or covid, since I always have allergies. It's not hurting very much, it's just kind of congested and it is feeling better today. But I am also feeling this weird sensation in my chest and throat sometimes that it's worrying me, sensation of difficulty to breathe. I don't know if it's covid or anxiety. Do I need to be worried? I was so worried that today I made an antigen test, it came out negative. Then I felt kind of relieved for a moment and the weird air sensation went away for a while, But now I'm worried again because I know there can be false negatives and the sensation is back, I don't know if it's covid, what do I do?? It's been 6 days since the contact with the people of the project. And 3 days since the weird sensations. Is the antigen test enough for me to not be worried? I am going to do another test this week, this time the molecular (PCR) one because it has a better sensitivity. Should I trust the result if ites negative?

176,"COVID depression I've had a week off of work and I know it sounds really bitchy for me to say this... but COVID restrictions have gotten to me. Like really gotten to me. It sucks because I haven't been able to do anything on this week off like go for a drink, out clubbing, meet with my friends, go for a coffee, clothes shopping. Literally anything apart from gaming and occasionally going to the supermarket. Like the thing is I'm a very introverted person usually, I love sitting down for nice long League sessions but therees a point where going without face-to-face social interaction is really fucking hard. And it's like I won't be able to just do something as simple as go round my best friends, have some vodka & coke and play some Smash Bros until probs Easter with COVID restrictions and it sucks.

Like I know it's a small thingpared to a killer virus but COVID restrictions seem to just really suck the joy out of life. The little things that make life not just surviving, but really living. It's really hard to deal with. Weirdly, mask wearing gets to me - it sucks having that constant reminder of what's happening everywhere sometimes, not being to see other people's faces. At this point I'm not even too worried about COVID as in getting it, I'm a 22 year old girl who can remember pretty much every time she's been ill because it doesn't happen often, like, if it happens, it happens, I'm young and healthy, I'm worried about parents who I live with yes but I'm not around vulnerable people. My parents are in their 50s, yes, but otherwise are pretty healthy. I'm of course following restrictions but that's what's difficult. Like following them isn't really easy. It's necessary but that doesn't make it any less hard. Idk. It's just really difficult. Worse because this has been going on for so fucking long now, it's not even new anymore. In March it was like novel at least. Now it's like... ffs, still? The end is in sight with vaccines thank god, but it's still a few more months of this crap yknow.

180,"Feeling like I lost everything I was looking forward to Hey guys. I'll start off by saying that my situation really isn't that badpared to others, I've just been feeling like I'm at a low point recently and I'm incredibly frustrated and need to get some things off my chest. This may just be screaming into the digital void or ranting but at least I can write my feelings down and maybe work through some things as I type.

I graduated college in May. While in college, I worked 30+ hours a week during the school year and 60+ hours a week in the summer to keep my student loans to a bare minimum. Always took the max number of credit hours so I could graduate early, was heavily involved in extracurricular activities, and had 4 internships over the course of my time in school so that I would have the opportunity to move out of my state and go somewhere new where I could at least pretend to make a new life for myself. 

I had 2 jobs offered to me in February and both ended up getting cancelled because of COVID. I graduated without a job and after months of applying for jobs in my field of studies and not getting a single interview,  I ended up taking a manual labor job in my home state in order to pay the bills and save up some money and have now been stuck here for 6 months. Not that there's anything wrong with manual labor jobs or the people employed in this field, but it's not intellectually challenging and I don't see any way for it to take me to places that I want to go or help me reach my goals. I guess I just feel overqualified to be in the position I'm in. I feel like I did pretty well for myself in school and had high expectations and hopes and every one of them has been cut down and all of the time I spent getting decent grades and working internships on top of my job on campus was for naught. 

Finally, I had been dating someone for the first time in a long time when March rolled around, but between the stress of COVID, losing out on two job offers, and now working a minimum of 55 hours a week, she left me over the summer because I couldn't find ways to be very positive about the situation,  never had much time to spend with her, and even when I did I was just too tired and forlorn to be interested in doing much. 

I don't know how to feel good about my situation and am afraid that all of the potential I had has been utterly destroyed and I don't see any way that this will change. Everything I was looking forward to and had worked my ass off for - moving away, starting a promising career, and having a significant other - have all been lost to me in a large part due to COVID. As winter approaches I have been experiencing a growing sense of dread and a lot of suicidal thoughts and emotions. I don't know what can be done nor do I think this post will change anything, but I just needed to talk about how hopeless I feel. I've got a roof over my head, clothes on my back, and food in my stomach, but I kinda just want to give up.

182,"Terrified for my boyfriend and I Some context: My boyfriend has been working from home since March. Overall we have been very cautious during this pandemic. But we live in the Seattle area, where cases spiked up like crazy this month. Since then, we have not left the house except to pick up groceries from curb side pickup, and I have to go to work twice a week for a total of three hours at a time. During that time, I only pass by one person— I work in my office alone during that time. I even wear my mask when I’m alone. 

With that being said, it doesn’t make sense to me that either of us should contract covid. 

My boyfriend started getting hives on his leg after we ate thanksgiving dinner a few days ago. We thought it might be the food, or some kind of allergic reaction, but it hasn’t gone away even though he’s been taking Benadryl multiple times a day. In fact, the hives have spread all over his body... his arms, up his back... I’m so scared for him. I’m terrified we’ve contracted covid somehow. Even though it’s seemingly rare, I’ve seen some people experience rashes when they have the illness. He has no other symptoms. I don’t have any symptoms, either.

I struggle with miserable anxiety, especially when ites to health. We live in a one bedroom, one bath apartment, and cannot really isolate from one another. But I’m still scared to be near him... which I feel awful about because he’s going through something very unusual. He can’t get a test right now because he has no “real” symptoms. 

We’re both 23, and have no health issues, but I’m terrified something bad will happen to us. I haven’t been able to stop crying all night because I feel so scared, lost, and lonely. I don’t want him to get sick, and I don’t want to get sick either. We’ve taken such care to be safe all this time.

Just need to work through this. So I wanted to be sure I was in the clear before going home to see my 50 year old mom who had a bad bout back in April for thanksgiving. Took a test Tuesday morning before getting on the road later that night. Got a negative result. As I’m traveling (by driving) my back starts to hurt super bad. I eventually chalk it up to driving so far. I get home but keep my mask on and wash my hands as soon as i walk through the door (no hugging or anything). I take my mask off to sleep but the door is closed. I sprayed disinfectant the following morning. I take a shower with out mask but spray the bathroom as well. Not really feeling like myself but I just chalk it up to being tired. Pop a few pain pills for my back. So now it’s thanksgiving and I’m freaking out cause i get this cough. I’m just like i gotta get outta here. Mom insists I stay and eat outside. So once again in a mask I’m outside eating and she’s inside. Left immediately afterwards on Thursday.

186,"Sick with worry with Christmasing up, I need moral support and logic to calm down Basically, I’m not worried for myself (22F, good health) but for my mom whom I still live with and still mostly dependent on. 

I love my mom and I’m constantly scared that she will catch it and die because she is : 
- overweight (not obese but maybe by 30lbs), has type 2 diabetes, is 60 y.o and has been a big smoker all her life. 

We’re taking all the precautions and basically me, dad and mom seeing legit no on for months (they work from home) and disinfecting groceries+shopping. We’re also in a good region (Canada, québec) where masks are mandatory indoors, no gatherings of any kind are allowed, and everything indoor is closed beside malls and shops. 

However our government said there could be some small gatherings allowed for christmas and I was able to convince my parents to celebrate just us three.

However for them to agree I still had topromise and for christmas we will 

1. go see grandma+her boyfriend only to say happy christmas (in her home, i’ll try to convince everyone to keep masks on but i doubt it’s going to work) but not staying for diner and 

2. they(my parents) will also go to a couple’s house for diner and we know they are generally pretty careful. (it will be only my parents + the couple)

But these two small outings for christmas still makes me so stressed i sometimes can’t sleep at night: what if mom’s friend got covid during her work and give it to my mom during the diner?? and then she dies. or if my grandma’s boyfriend wasn’t careful enough and got it and gives it to my mom??

I know at this point, will all the precautions and those only two small outings the chances of one of us three getting it are low (i think) but it’s like, even if there’s only 0.5% chance of getting it AND that mom dies, it’s still making me have anxiety attacks and I am stressed out 24/7 with catastrophic scenarios playing out in my head

Tl;dr: my mom has health issues and we three (mom, dad and me) adopt strict precautions. But they will be having two small outings this Christmas and it’s giving me anxiety attacks bc i dont want my mom to die if she gets it.",1,0.67,k30tb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k30tb0/sick_with_worry_with_christmas_coming_up_i_need/,1,Support,2020-11-29,-12,134,-0.08955223880597014

But, since I know the dirt came from the floor from wearing the socks I am panicking.

I live in a very small place, so there's no way I can 100% avoid wearing my shoes in the main walkway and am sure I am tracking the virus indoors.

197,"How To Stop Venting And Stay Positive During The Pandemic? A little bit of background. I'm 20 years old, male, and live a nice life. I am currently taking care of my grandparents, and everybody in my family has been in good health since we've been diligent about social distancing, following guidelines, and such.

I would say my life is good in the grand scheme of things. We're all healthy, I have a wonderful family, and we go to the beach frequently since we're near there and it's a safe place to have some recreation. I'm also able to work from home. I have amazing pets that I love dearly that make me feel happy.

With that being said, December ising up. And I'm starting to get flashbacks about how amazing December of 2019 was. I used to be nervous about getting into relationships and friendships but I managed to have a girlfriend for a bit last December and it made me feel fulfilled. Even though it didn't work out, I had the confidence to go out and meet new people and be more social. It seemed to be a new beginning for my social life. Then March came along and screwed up everything. I haven't seen anyone outside of my family since then and it's really taking a toll on me. Like I said, we're following COVID guidelines very strictly.

I'm sure this is no different than how many people are feeling. But it's really frustrated me more than ever recently. I have friends and girls who want to see me, but I can't because I don't want to risk catching COVID and giving it to my grandparents. I feel that all the effort to stay safe has been meaningless. I will always do my part and wear a mask and social distance. But I feel hopeless.

I have a bad habit of venting. I know there's nothing I can do to stop others from not caring. I vent about wanting to leave the state or even the country because I can't handle the ammount of selfishness here. Anytime I say something like this, I'm always told ""there are people who have it much worse"". ""There are people out of work, people who are in food lines, and people who are sick."" And yes, that is true. I'm grateful that I'm not experiencing any or these. I'm also told that I'm always negative and everyone's in the same boat. Maybe I am. I just really need help finding a way to suppress the negative thoughts and be positive. I've tried. I've really tried. But everytime I hear bad news regarding it, it triggers that anger and negativity. It reminds me we're that much further from safe social interaction like in 2019.

199,"Am I Even Allowed to Have a Bad Day? Because Today was Bad. Preface: I don't claim to be the only person in a situation like this--in fact, it's why I'm here. I'm just feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and isolated in a mind-bendy sort of way.

Also, this is long. I apologize for that.

I'm the youngest of three children in my family. The oldest is on the edge of 50, with grown/teenage children of his own. My sister, a nurse, is 45 and has no children. I'm 43, have no children, and have the insane luck and luxury to have been able to work from home since March. We have one elderly parent (Mom) who currently lives with and takes care of my grandmother, who will be 100 years old this Sunday. My husband and I are currently living in my mom's house while she resides with Grandmother, so that we can be on hand to help her and take care of her household and pets in her absence. (My brother and sister live locally as well--just FYI.)

I told you all of that so that you understand that while I'm not an only child, I am the one child in the most reasonable position to handle the shopping and errands. Some days, that makes me feel like I'm the expendable one in everyone's eyes, but that's usually when I'm hungry and/or haven't slept much. For the most part, I don't mind. 

My brother does jack to help, like ever, and takes it as an insult if he's asked. My sister does what she can, when she can, and steps in as nurse whenever Mom or G'mother need it. I do the grocery shopping, pick up prescriptions, hunt for lost animals, pay the bills, call customer support, fix theputer, fix the phone, put out fires, listen to problems, and just generally do all the running around. I also work full time as a college advisor, so my students need me, too.

I'm decent at juggling. It makes me testy sometimes, because there is a fair amount of stress involved, bit I do okay. Just... Not today.

Today, I was at the grocery store in my small southern town, huffing and puffing under my mask, and my sister called. I was standing in the deli/bakery section, near the front, sandwiched between a display of DIY ugly sweater sugar cookie kits and the end cap of the freezer section, listening to my sister vent about her mother-in-law, and I realized.... I'm surrounded by people with no masks. I glance off in the direction of the cashiers, and their masks are hooked below their chin. Even the store manager is wandering around with her nose sticking out above her mask.

This isn't a new situation for me. Being the most out-and-about one in the family, I'm used to seeing the idiots en masse. I still wear my mask, regardless, and I still have my routine of hand sanitizer as soon as I get in my car, along with hand washing and disinfecting keys, phone, drink cup, etc. when I get home. Clothes immediately go into the hamper. I, at least, know how to follow directions from the experts in this pandemic, even if no one else out there can be bothered. 

But for some reason, my mind chose today to just not handle it well. I felt isolated and a little bit panicked--kinda like showing up for a black tie event in jeans and sneakers. I started questioning if maybe I just hallucinated the last 8-9 months. Or maybe I was a weirdo who was taking things waaaay too seriously.

Then I looked down at the jelly beans I'd slipped into the cart for my grandmother, because they're her favorite and I'm ovepensating for not being able to waltz in unannounced and surprise her with hugs and kisses--for not doing that enough when I could, before all this mess started, frankly--and down came my I-can-do-this pillars. 

I realized how emotionally exhausted I am. The alarm to start quarantining was sounded here literally on my birthday. I snuck up to my grandmother's house late that night and cried and waved to her and my mom from the dining room, approximately 10 feet away. I've been varying degrees of ""distanced"" since then, though I have given my mom a hug a couple of times when it was safe and she clearly needed it. All the special days we would have gathered for as a family since then have been debated and battled between the do-rights and the hoaxers in my family. IN MY EAR. (Why do they call me?? I don't know! The only answer I can give is ""y'all do what you want; I'll visit Grandmother in the evening after everyone else has left. But if she gets sick..."") There was no Thanksgiving. There will be no Christmas. And today, I guess I just couldn't handle it. 

How do I reconcile what I'm doing with the actions of everyone else around me? How do I keep biting my tongue when I'm trapped in the ladies room with Karen Nomask as she loftily tells everyone present that no one is going to tell her what to do and she really doesn't think it's as bad as ""mainstream media"" is saying it is--and everyone is agreeing with her?? How do I ease my mind when I start worrying for the millionth time this week that if anyone in my family is going to track something in from the outside world, it's going to be me, because I'm the only one out there who has repeated contact with those most vulnerable? 

I do so well to stand up straight and stay focused most days, but when I have a bad day, it's really, really bleak. And today was pretty bad. So, any advice or encouragement to help me back onto the rails and keep me chugging along until this is over would be greatly appreciated. If you have none, that's okay. Writing it down has helped, too.

 Thats a separate issue all together, but I am having some questions/issues with the way the hospital is treating her.

The docs are saying her labs are fine, blood gases are fine, temp is fine. Heart rate, blood pressure is high. She has high blood pressure anyway though and takes meds for it.

They did 2 CT scans, first one showed some swelling the second one they said it showed none.

The doctor called this morning and said she is in rough shape and probably wont survive. white blood cell count is at 45 after being 16 a few hours earlier.

205,"it's been 10 months since i've hugged my family this summer, i talked my mom out of taking a trip toe see me and my brother, who lives in a different place in the same city as me. I sort of regret that now. after much crying and stress, she decided to book an air bnb that had good precautions in place for as soon as it was available. that was december. we all knew it might get worse before then. today she just canceled that trip.

i'm glad she did - it would have been a really dangerous thing to do, and wildly irresponsible. 

but it's not like her situation at home is safe - her partner goes to work every day, as does my sibling who is local to her and visits. sometimes she still goes out to the store in person. she doesn't have many risk factors other than age, but this virus doesn't always care about that.

so while i'm glad she's taking this seriously and did the right thing, i am haunted by the possibility that she or one of my siblings could get it, and even die, and i wouldn't have seen them, hugged them, since january. 

i know it was the right thing to do not to travel earlier, but if i'd known how bad it was going to get, i would have travelled down there in early summer and hugged them all so hard.

i live alone, and have been incredibly strict with myself. I've seen my brother only a few times for a few seconds outside, to give him supplies, from 6 feet away. last week a puppy ran up to me on a late night walk and i pet it, and it was the first time i'd touched another living thing other than a tree or a bug in 10 months. 

and you know, i can deal with that. I could deal with this for another year, if I had to. What I can't deal with is the fact that if i were to lose one of my family members, i would be doing so having not given them a hug or held their hand in basically a year. what i can't deal with is the anxiety that any day i could get the news i fear the most.

i lost my father suddenly several years ago, and my best friend in an accident about ten years ago now. to this day every time the phone rings i expect the worst. and i know if ites i won't be able to deal with having not been able to give them a hug in so long.

i didn't realize how much i was looking forward to that trip, in addition to dreading it, until it was canceled. and i'm furious at everyone whose let it get this bad, who is travelling now, who isn't doing all they can to prevent this.

i just needed somewhere to vent, i guess, but i'd love to hear how anyone in the same boat is dealing with this.",13,1,k1ul2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k1ul2p/its_been_10_months_since_ive_hugged_my_family/,0,Support,2020-11-27,-13,128,-0.1015625
206,"Question about isolating? I'm high risk (COPD) and my GF is low risk. We've been together in the house since March. She needs to visit her families home for a week and there are 6 people living there in close quarters. Including children that may not have shown signs of a previous infection, nor know how to use PPE properly. Two family members were already sick with 'a flu' a few months ago - who knows....

* When she returns back to our house I'm going to move upstairs for 14 days. Effectively quarantining myself from her. But I'm still not sure that's right:
* 14 days is the longest it should take to manifest symptoms for her - right?
* Since she's 23 and low-risk, isn't it still dangerous that she could have caught CV19 at home, brought it back here, and just not show symptoms?
* The worst case - she goes to her family, returns home infected. Will isolating for 14 days protect my health? Or if she has it, but not symptomatic - couldn't I still catch it? For instance Day 1: returns home, has CV19, Day 14: still no symptoms but active case - would I be infected when we move back into the same room?

What's the best practice in this situation? There are no tests available in the country we live in.

So today I went to my parents house for Thanksgiving. We live down the road from each other. In addition to them, there were my step-siblings and their spouses. All in all about 8 people. 2 of those 8 people have already had COVID a few months ago. We sat indoors. IDK why we didn't eat outdoors or better yet just do this via Zoom. I feel stupid for attending and hope that I don't have COVID now .No one displayed any symptoms but I still worry some people could be asymptomatic.




I have been super careful for the past 9 months. I work from home and live by myself so my contact with other people has been minimal except for my parents. In addition, I got an anti-body test a few months back and it was negative. I am 29 years old with no underlying health conditions.

Overall I am very concerned I have COVID and I regret attending. I should have said no. Ughh",7,0.77,k1uj7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k1uj7w/went_to_family_gathering_8_people_now_very_nervous/,5,Support,2020-11-27,-6,55,-0.10909090909090909
208,"I don’t know what’s right and what’s real anymore Today I saw a post of Amanda Kloots, the widow of Nick Cordero who died of Covid this year, be greeted by her sister who had been living in Paris this year at her home in California.

It just... broke me. Okay, so she obviously didn’t quarantine in a hotel for 14 days because she posted that she was on the plane last night. She tested twice beforehand, and is planning to test twice afterwards. I’m guessing they’re wearing masks indoors until she gets the all clear... but isn’t CDC rmending no travel that’s nonessential? I get that Amanda has had a terribly unfortunate circumstance and year and I cannot imagine being in her position, but would you all claim that what her sister did was essential?

I was planning on traveling by air to visit my parents out of state next month for Christmas. Meanwhile, the world is apparently being burned down by Covid. And no matter what I do, my brother will never approve of me visiting home. Why? Well, the CDC is rmending not to travel, but also if you do travel to get tested, but also is saying that negative tests DON’T mean you don’t have it, but positive tests definitely do mean you have it, BUT also we’re thinking of shortening the “rmended” quarantine of 14 days.

Like?????? I’m so fucking confused. If I was smart, I would just be stoic as hell and do absolutely nothing that would rock the boat until the world sorts itself out, but I’m starting to feel like it will be a very long time til the world is “OK” again. When being outdoors doesn’t send people in a panic. I feel jipped and jilted because some people are being able to see their families but my brother (a 22 year old who can be very self-righteous and always follows the status quo) is not ok with me visiting, even though I’m trying to do it as safe possible by quarantining for 2 weeks beforehand (except for grocery runs and being in the office for work, masked 100% of the time), testing before my trip, and getting tested 4-5 days after I arrive. But again, the tests are absolutely meaningless because everyone has it. But the IFR is still too high. But ya, nope, a lot of people have it and we just don’t see it. And initially the media’s big line was that our testing capacity was never enough, we need more testing, but wait.... now we definitely have the capacity, hold on, hold on, I’m just getting word now that tests are useless and it doesn’t change anything? Ok nvm then. Stay home, but it’s ok if you don’t.

209,"My friends are ostracizing me because I am taking COVID precautions... (rant) Hi all! I just need to vent right now. None of my friends are taking COVID precautions seriously and are making me feel terrible for it. I live with my parents right now, I’m currently in grad school (so I have a lot to keep busy with regardless!), and I work with immunpromised individuals (on top of having asthma). I’ve been working, studying, and spending time with my boyfriend who literally only sees me and my immediate family right now.

Tonight, my friends had a get together for thanksgiving eve. I declined of course (we have over 10,000 cases per day in my state right now), and they’re all drunk basically telling me that all I’m doing is sitting at home doing nothing and they’d rather spend time with eachother living life instead of sitting at home doing nothing.

I’m in tears right now. One of those “friends” had an uncle that passed today due to COVID, yet none of them care. I feel like I’m being the over cautious, boring one, but I know the vaccine is on the horizon and I don’t want to risk hurting anyone I care about or risk catching the virus myself.

I’ve been going through depression over this (I’m normally the social butterfly so being so closed off is really hard for me) and now that they said this I feel 10x worse.

Any personal anecdotes would be appreciated, I’m feeling pretty lousy right now.

I was hanging out with a friend last Tuesday (outside but without masks) when she told me her BF lost his sense of taste and smell. She had no idea it was a COVID symptom. So she got tested last Friday and it was negative. 

The day after I saw her (Wednesday) I started having a dry cough that is annoying but not serious. 

I got tested on Sunday as a precaution just to make sure I don’t have it. I tested negative as well. 

I still have the cough and no other symptoms other than my normal allergies. I’ve been checking my temperature constantly and I’ve been normal. I’ve never had a dry cough from my allergies before. 

Should I get re-tested?
Note: I’ll be contacting my urgent care tomorrow to see what they suggest anyways.

212,"Financially trapped with risk-taking housemates Frustrated and sad while all my housemates are at thanksgiving celebrations.

&#x200B;

My boyfriend (34M) and I (28F) live with 3 other housemates also in their late 20s/early 30s. One other couple and a woman whose boyfriend does not live with us. We thought we were all friends when we moved in but I have since been proven wrong by their behavior. Since the beginning, the housemate's boyfriend has beening over in spite of shelter in place, and since shelter in place lifted in CA, this boyfriend has basically gone back to socializing with friends. We tried to negotiate a limited bubble but he basically told us our anxieties aren't his problem and my housemate still goes off to parties with him. Recently our other housemates have been tagging along. Months of negotiations failed, and the setup of the house makes isolation from them next to impossible (shared bathroom, small kitchen, her WFH setup in the living room.)

&#x200B;

So my partner and made the decision to get out of the living situation, except...we can't. I didn't realize his credit was so bad before this (we just joined onto an existing lease for the place we currently live, so no credit check), so if we try to apply together, his credit gets us rejected. I'm a graduate student, so even though I have good credit, if I apply alone my ie does not meet the 2x rent cutoff. The rental market ispetitive, and we have yet to find a place that allows cosigners that isn't student housing which he's not eligible for because he's not a student and we aren't married. Obviously outside of a pandemic, the thing that makes the most financial sense is living with housemates...but I don't know anyone looking for a roommate and I don't want to chance ending up in a similar situation with a random roommate.

&#x200B;

We've been searching for months and just keep getting stuck and I'm just so sad about it with cases rising and the holidays uing. I was really hoping we'd get our own place so we could quarantine fully for Christmas with his parents (none of us have to leave the house for work so we could get groceries and really not leave the house for 14 days)

It sucks being isolated from people yet still at the same risk I would be if I was seeing my friends. It's the worst of both worlds and I don't see any light at the end of the tunnel.

214,"Am I Overreacting or Being Selfish? Although the vaccine news has been *amazing,* I have been a little bummed lately. I keep seeing news articles and Reddit posts saying that even after a vaccine, masks and social distancing will have to continue. I understand that a certain amount of the population needs to get the vaccine, and that a vaccine won't just be a light switch back to normal. I wouldn't mind wearing a mask maybe a month or two after receiving the second dose of a vaccine. But none of these experts are being transparent or realistic about when all of these measures will end for good. Going back to normal is really the only incentive I have for getting a vaccine in the first place since I hate shots and cry every time I get one. But I'm willing to be be miserable twice just to get my life back. Why I would I do that if I can't even move on with life?

I can't wait for this stupid pandemic to end...no more loud, obnoxious children at home all the time making loud sounds and being noisy...why do children feel the need to STOMP everywhere?! I live in an apartment...below a cruddy family with small kids. I am a childfree woman, meaning I never want to procreate myself. It sucks. No, I do not think it is cute or silly or funny or whatever...I miss the previous tenant that lived above me. He would just spontaneously burst into song! I don't usually care about singing or musicals...but it was funny! Gave me a laugh. I wonder where he is now...

My roommate is home all the time when he is not working. He doesn't have a social life. He does work outside the home for his job, but I don't feel disturbed by that. I otherwise trust him and feel that he takes the appropriate precautions. He is a very orderly and clean and quiet person. However, after living months on end, with lack of socializing opportunities and my other personal problems that I am very private about...you inevitably begin to hate who you feel that you are stuck in cabin fever with.

Actually, this is the first time ever that I have had to live with a roommate. I wish he was always traveling far away or something and was never or barley home and just sent the money for rent through mail or whatever...ha =D Anyway...yes...his working for his family business means, unfortunately, week long vacations of being home all the time around holidays. He has been home all week...and I hate it. His smokers cough annoys me, his wearing of his damn large shows bugs me for some reason...very dumb little things make me have aical image in my head of chucking him over our balcony =P

Before this pandemic, I was already dealing with some really bad personal problems, but things were getting better. Therapy was actually progressing in a positive way, and my medication was working well. Now...therapy by phone sucks, but I do it every week anyway. I still take my medication everyday, even though I can barely feel any positive effects through this numb haze I seem to have developed to cope with this nonsense. This years election was highly stressful for me, and I am so happy that it is over, and also with result that I am very relieved about...I do my best to avoid too much news in general.

Tonight, last might grocery shopping before I got to visit with my mom and dad tomorrow for a very small and sanitized Thanksgiving. I am thankful that me and my folks have all been healthy and safe so far, of course (I am an only child), but for some reason, on my drive back home...I just burst into uncontrollable sobbing.

I miss in person interactions, I miss in person therapy a lot too...I am an introvert who gets strong extrovert moods. I used to and now crave going to clubs to dance...going to concerts with mosh pits and heavy brutal music. I miss those atmospheres...I miss being around people. I miss sex. I really human touch.

217,"Yesterday I became someone I loathe, and I'm not sure how to recover from it [repost to follow sub rules] Quick background: I have multiple conditions that leave me vulnerable to COVID. Pre-pandemic, I had latent but manageable anxiety, but during the pandemic it blossomed into fully-fledged, diagnosed PTSD. Yesterday, I definitely found myself in the grips of my PTSD, and behaved terribly.

Yesterday, I was shopping at Sprouts, which I've found to be generally safer and more on top of their mask game than other supermarkets. But they don't enforce their mask policy with customers, and this being Florida, we have more than a few anti-maskers.

In walked a middle-age woman wearing her mask as a chinstrap, your typical fakepliance. I rolled my eyes, but kept my distance. A few minutes later I was grabbing some cheese, and I turn to find her face within like a foot of mine. I jet out of there, mumbling something like ""asshole"" under my breath (by the way, this reactivity on my part is not something I'm proud of).

A few minutes later, I see her heading my way and she is smirking at me, like an absolutely, unmistakably sinister Joker-wide grin. I don't think it's just in my head at this point to think that this was a straight-up ""trigger the libs"" anti-mask provocateur.

As we pass each other, I say ""there's something wrong with you."" Again, not proud of how easily I was was triggered. It turned into an ugly confrontation, with most of the uglinessing from me. A fair amount of ""fuck yous"" and ""keep your fucking distance from me"", ending with me saying ""try not to kill any grandparents"" and her concern-trolling with ""I'm sorry you're sick.""

I went home wracked with sobs. I was not only having a PTSD near-panic attack, but I became someone I just cannot stand. Reactive, vulgar, hateful. Assuming she was indeed looking to trigger, I gave her everything she wanted. I feelpletely humiliated, and I hate that this is who I've be, I wish I were normal again. Whatever her justifications were when she said it, she was right: I am sick, and I can't stand it.

I'm having a rough time. I'm in therapy, I meditate, but I still feel out of control and too easily triggered.

I’m not assertive enough to confront someone on that; and if I tell an attendant, will they be effective? If they’re not, how will I deal with it? 

Just a few days ago, I went grocery shopping. It was fairly crowded. People were wearing masks, but I was flipping out. Pretty sure I left grip marks on my cart handle (jk but I was white-knuckling it for sure). 

I would be quarantining for 10 days (at my parents’ place, in my room) when I arrive. Still, I’m afraid to contract covid and/or pass it onto my parents. 

They actually flew from a similar place I’m at now to get their home a few months ago. Their flights were very crowded, yet they did not fall ill. 

I’m worried they’ll think I’m overreacting by staying put. Also worried their friends will think I’m being too paranoid. I’m one of the safest covid people I know and my parents know (though they’re fairly safe themselves). 

I also will feel like a hypocrite if I fly out during the holidays; I’m pretty quick to roll my eyes at anyone even hinting at socializing. 

But then I’m also conflicted about still not seeing my parents. Still not socializing. Spending xmas alone. Haven’t seen anyone I know in person in months outside of limited work (literally 1 day - possibly 2 more in a week). 

Speaking of which, I’m still open to “risking it” for work, yet not doing it for family seems wrong? Is it? 

I mean... over 1M deaths worldwide. When I consider that, I can’t help but think anyone who’s traveling is close to braindead. Yet, many people seem to be, so maybe I’m overreacting. 

Sorry if me even considering going is unnerving to anyone who’s been strictly socially distancing and is resolute in continuing to do so.",2,1,k198r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k198r7/travel_dilemma/,9,Support,2020-11-26,-13,135,-0.0962962962962963
224,"I'm feeling tired and lost during my country's second lockdown Hey guys!

I live in Greece and we're currently going through our second lockdown and I feel so lost and tired and bored.

The first lockdown went fine. I had some very stressful months regarding first jobs. I'm 23, I graduated last year and found my first job (not related to my degree in history) in October and worked that one and another one until late January. Then, I found a job for the summer (which ended up being cancelled due to covid), so I sat back and relaxed. I enjoyed the first lockdown because it gave me the opportunity to relax and slow down etc. I played Sims, did online classes, watched tv series, all that fun stuff. I didn't leave the house for a month (I live with parents so they did shopping etc) and I was fine with it.

During the first lockdown I decided I want to go back to school, this time for graphic design. It'd be tough money wise, but I could manage, especially if I found a job. I started in late October, did about a week worth of classes and then a second lockdown was announced. I decided to drop out of school for this year, because I couldn't afford it.

I now feel so tired and lost. All these months I was trying to be productive. I guess I thought that I should use this time to, idk, write a novel or learn coding or whatever. Ipleted about 27 classes on Coursera via some program. I practiced Russian. I read books. I learned drawing.

At this point, I don't feel like doing anything. I feel lost, I don't know what else to do. I feel like I should spend this time productively and idk, I guess learn some sort of skill that will help me career wise. I'm really worried about that, seeing that I have a ""useless"" degree and live in a country with a bad economy. I'm scared that lockdown will end and I'll still be jobless, have no friends (I didn't really have the chance to establish myself back in my hometown as I was studying in a different city) and all this time in lockdown will have been for nothing.

I hope this post isn't too depressing. I don't feel depressed per se, I have a will to do *something* I just don't know where to direct this energy that I have and end up being on my phone almost all day.",12,1,k0z5pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k0z5pi/im_feeling_tired_and_lost_during_my_countrys/,5,Support,2020-11-26,-4,139,-0.02877697841726619
225,"Best solution to this issue? Hello, Around 7 days ago. I took a trip to the store to buy groceries with my mom. When leaving the grocery store, a homeless man approached us. He asked if we had any extra money. My mom said no to him. I then checked my bag, and saw I had an extra two dollars. I told my mom I wanted to give him some money. So my mom called him back over. The homeless man kept his distance from us, more than 6 feet. When I was searching through my purse. I found the two dollars, and I reached out my hand and he also reached out his hand. We both kept distance of 5-6ft I believe. He said thank you. I said no problem. This whole exchange lasted around 20-30secconds I believe. Then my mom said, he wasn't wearing a mask. I panicked a bit. I totally didn't realize he didn't have a mask on. I was wearing an n95 mask, plus a cloth mask over it. However, I didn't have eye protection at all. So that concerned me if possible, if his droplets could have entered my eyes? when he did briefly speak to us. I felt most likely I would be okay. However, today, I have a bit of a sore throat I believe? But to include, I did have a migraine today, and im about to get my period. I saw online sometimes women can experience sore throats or other PMS symptoms. I'm not sure if I ever had a sore throat during my period, but I've felt pretty crappy when I get migraines. But the whole exchange with the homeless man, has me feeling a bit concerned, and a certain type of way. I told my mom, I want to quarantine in my room for thanks giving and that I will tell the family how I am feeling. to let them know what we should do next, or change thanksgiving plans. My mom told me, I am being too paranoid, creating a fiasco for no reason, and creating unnecessary fear, because I most likely don't have the virus. I want to tell my other family members what's happening. my mom said when a women's hormone changes during the cycle, I can feel this way, but im not 100% percent sure? I've been wearing a mask around the house, and will have to take it off for thanksgiving, my mom said.  I can't get a test until after thanksgiving :(",1,0.6,k1aswt,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k1aswt/best_solution_to_this_issue/,2,NA,2020-11-26,-11,127,-0.08661417322834646
226,"Advice needed, how risky is this? What can be done? So, tomorrow is Thanksgiving. I own my house, my grandmother has been living with me for a couple years now, we live in Texas. She has decided to invite her son (my uncle) tomorrow, who has to work in a public-facing role that already had a covid scare from a coworker at his work location. As far as I know, he wears a mask but he has a thick beard, and when hees over he tends to forget to put his mask back on after eating.

Along with this, my mother (shees over often and is the most cautious of my family, always wears a mask) and her boyfriend (not cautious) are alsoing over. He came by Monday, and I already feel that he exposed us. He works as an elementary school teacher.

When mom's boyfriend was here Monday, he ate, didn't put his mask back on, sat on the couch where my grandma usually sits, and coughed many times while sitting there. My grandma refuses to wear a mask in the house, but I had mine on. When they left I sprayed the air with Lysol and the couch where he sat.

All of them cough except my mom have been coughing since pre-covid times. My grandmother coughs openly into the air, my uncle coughs into his elbow, and my mom's boyfriend coughs openly into the air as well.

I want to know, how big is the risk tomorrow? I plan to get my food first, and eat in my room. My mom says she will try to get her boyfriend to leave right after he eats so he doesn't start coughing without a mask on again, but I don't have much faith in this working. 

Even if they all leave right after eating, my grandma will still be maskless in close contact with them all. I then have to live with her. I have no idea what else I can do. So yeah, how big is my risk tomorrow eating in my room away from everyone and wearing two masks when they're here, cleaning as much as possible after they leave? Is there anything else I could do to lower my risk? I can't afford to leave, I wouldn't want to anyway since this is my house to begin with. I can't tell people not toe without causing a huge fight, and all other suggestions like eating outside or eating distanced get ignored.

UPDATE: Mom's boyfriend isn'ting after all! Still nervous about my uncle but I have a better chance at convincing him to stay masked up and distanced now. Thanks for the support on here!",1,0.67,k1aozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k1aozt/advice_needed_how_risky_is_this_what_can_be_done/,7,Support,2020-11-26,-1,139,-0.007194244604316547
227,"How to reconcile living with a family member who is not as concerned I'm having troubleing to terms that my brother and I are on different wavelengths. I've (M22) known that he (M22) is very much on a different page than me from the beginning. However, he did magnificently well with staying home when things started in March. He really didn't do much from March through June I'd say. He continued to pretty much stay home, but now, within the past week, as COVID cases are rising exponentially in my area, he's been with 2 groups of people and going to the gym. I'm furious.

We live with our parents (M60, F56), both high risk, and my dad just had knee replacement surgery on Monday. We have all worn masks since the beginning, are good with quarantining, don't do anything unnecessary, etc. Now, I have severe OCD/health anxiety so much of these ""rules"" are because of me. Surprisingly, I tested positive 10/29 after my first social visit since March. You can read about it in a past post as that's a whole different story thatpletely boggles the mind. My risk for infection was incredibly low according to my doctor, and he didn't advise quarantine, nor did the CDC based on their guidelines, but I still did because my absolute worst fear was infecting my parents should I be sick. My mom is very good at understanding, but my dad...he just doesn't care. He follows the rules well but he doesn't care like my mom and I do. I'm thankful I decided to quarantine to be extra safe as I'm sure the oue of my family's negative tests would've been different had I not. In fact, I still wear a mask and try to stay socially distant. My brother couldn't even wear a mask when he was in quarantine between my positive test and the results of his test negative test. 

My mom is extremely worried, but I think I worry about my dad more than he worries about himself. I told my mom my brother needs to wear a mask and do his best to quarantine after this little shindig. It was a bigmotion about him going, very dramatic, but he ended up going because my parents (mostly my mom) don't want to have to deal with his shitty attitude. He did mention his mental health is suffering, which I do believe, but it's so hard for me to reconcile this because my mental health is not good ( I'm the only one in the family in therapy) but I'm also 100% more scared about my parents getting sick. But he also said he doesn't want therapy because the ""gym is his therapy"" omg but I digress. I totally believe COVID fatigue is a thing and that our mental healths are suffering from this experience. But I also think he's being incredibly selfish, and frankly, I don't want him around here if he's going to make the decision for us about who we get to be exposed to. There's been talk about him getting an apartment in the area for now (he has a job lined up in another city - he started work in August - but it's WFH until at least June). This would be the most ideal solution.

But basically, I know I can't control other people - but what can I do to ensure my parents don't get sick? My parents have been very careful - my mom more than my dad - and as I never would've forgiven myself if I had gotten them sick, I don't know how I could ever forgive him for getting them sick due to his selfish behavior. I just don't know what to do and I wish he cared at the level I care. Everything I say to him just goes in one ear and out the other. He even admitted he'd rather have COVID than still be stuck inside. I don't understand this mindset as having COVID - even with my own symptoms being basically nonexistent - was one of the most traumatizing and upsetting experiences. 

Sorry if this is a mess of writing. I had to vent, too. :(

tl;dr: my brother has gone out twice in the past week, goes to the gym, and doesn't seem to worry as much about our parents and I'm ufortable with the level of activity he'sfortable with.",1,0.57,k19wdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k19wdn/how_to_reconcile_living_with_a_family_member_who/,4,Support,2020-11-26,-24,221,-0.1085972850678733
228,"Possibly Exposed at the dentist, freaking out. Okay, I know I should not have gone to a dentist. But my issue started in March and I had ignored it till now due to fear of catching covid. But now it got severe and turns out I needed a root canal. So yesterday was my last sitting and my regular dentist wasn't there. After the procedure I called him on his personal number (we are friends), that time he let me on the fact that he had corona and recovering at home. He insisted he did not get it while at work but from his neighbor with whom he had some interaction at the apartment and also at the clothing shop his neighbor runs. And nobody at the dentists office had it.


But still I am panicking. My wife is 5 months pregnant. I have temporarily isolated myself in the guest room.
Also as a side note:  I suffer from severe dust allergies and have a runny nose nearly 24x7.(one of the gifts of living in one of the most polluted industrial towns in the world.) So even if I get sick and one of the symptoms was cold and runny nose I would not know.


Edit: additional information.
1 dentist wore his N95 mask the entire time.

2 he did remove his face shield for some time.

3 I wear mask as soon as I step out. It's a double/triple layer home made cotton cloth mask. (I have many).

231,"Extreme Covid fatigue - need some support Hi all. I am feeling really stressed out and have been for awhile. I’m really glad I found this sub. 

I’m a female, 26 and married with a 10 month old daughter. She was born in February and I thought that was hard. Right when I wasing up for a breath of air from the newborn phase, covid hit. In fact the first weekend in March I baby wore her to a drag show and then a brewery tour. I was feeling so optimistic and happy to be a mom. Then the next week, everything imploded. 

Luckily I work for my mom and with my sister so we have a bubble. I also have a good friend with two kids who we bubble with. I do go out to eat. While many many people consider these behaviors too risky, I wear my mask everywhere and limit myself to 2 restaurants and one entirely outdoor brewery. Even with all this support I am struggling badly. 

My daughter’s entire first year of life has been ruined. I can’t excite myself for her holidays because there is no Santa, no Christmas events, no Christmas parties, no familying to visit. We bought a new house about 3 months ago and it’s our dream home, but only affordable because we have two ies. I worry she will have to be home schooled and I’ll have to quit my job. I wake up in a cold sweat every night panicking about her future. I worry that she will never go to school, play sports, go to concerts, have friends, go to the movies, travel, enjoy an amusement park, etc. The idea of her living her life entirely masked pains to me to absolutely no end. She has literally never even been to a park, the zoo, aquarium, anything. I can barely take her to the grocery store because she’s scared of masks. As of right now I feel she won’t have siblings either because how could I knowingly bring another baby into this mess? Whenever I discuss this with my husband he tells me it must end sometime and that I need to get a grip on my anxiety. But of course, everyone is saying even with a vaccine we will need masks for a long time and social isolation will continue. I’m seriously concerned. I thought about moving but there’s no where to go that doesn’t require masks. 

To top it off my grandparents arepletely off the conspiracy deep end. My husband has had to intervene several times to get them to stop calling and messaging me their conspiracy theories. I do my best to ignore them and repeat to myself their words are not rooted in fact but they’ve basically told me my daughter will have to live out her life entirely masked in a globalmunist take over. This is obviously false but it has be a very intrusive thought for me.

I tried teletherapy but it was only over the phone so I never got a good connection. I tried explaining to therapist how triggering masks are for me but she dismissed me much the same as my husband. I explained about my grandparents and she thought they were really funny. I guess I’m just looking for some resources, similar stories, or maybe scientific journals or actual fact based articles that at some point we can take our masks off and resume life.",5,0.73,k0w60i,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k0w60i/extreme_covid_fatigue_need_some_support/,6,NA,2020-11-26,-15,185,-0.08108108108108109

I have seen a lot of posts from sufferers of Ocd on here and I hope the mods will allow me to post this to target those who share my disorder with advice for fellow ocd-folks. I fear that OCD sufferers wille on the sub Reddit and do some thing that is actually very harmful for their illness: asking reassurance.

I just wanted to share a few pointers/ways to deal with anxiety that traditionally helped me, balanced with covid awareness. I’m not a doctor, but I hope some of this helps

1. Get a therapist you can talk with that is aware of OCD treatment and that does telehealth. shop around

2. This workbook i have seen posted on here is actually really similar to stuff my doc has given me 

3. Typical OCD Fear of germs/or fears of potentially harming your friends or family/ etc are normal around this time. In pre pandemic times my therapist did exposure therapy with me and made me hold dirty things/purposefully sit near family etc. You can’t do typical exposure therapy in this time, but that’s OK! You can do “imaginal exposure.” Here’s a link  that explains how “imaginable exposure” works. As always do this with the guidance of a psychologist or therapist 

4. Do NOTe on this subreddit or others to ask for reassurance for OCD thoughts. Reassurance creates a feedback loop of anxiety. More info here

5. Journal things you are thankful for. Keep track of positive news/vaccine updates etc. We will make it

6. Reach out if you need help. Don’t sit on anxiety or think it’s unimportant because of the  pandemic",33,0.97,k0hz1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k0hz1r/covid_coping_advice_for_ocd_sufferers/,4,Resources,2020-11-25,-8,129,-0.06201550387596899
238,"Is there a protocol for suspected COVID from back when tests were unavailable? I was suuuuper sick at the end of January. At the time we thought there were only like 5 COVID cases in the country, but in hindsight we know it was more widespread than we realized. I went to Disneyland and several LA-area political rallies, which is where I suspect I could have been exposed.

I had double eye infections, double ear infections, bronchitis, sinusitis, and pharyngitis. I was coughing so much that it kept me up at night, and the sore throat was so bad that it hurt to eat, drink, and speak. One morning my eyes were so swollen that I could only open them about a centimeter. I was in bed for 2 weeks and missed my first week on spring semester. I had  a fever that broke in the middle of the night, after which I felt  a little better and tried to go to school, but then I got hit with a second round that took me out for another week of school, this time with a low-grade fever.

I did three different rounds of antibiotics. They were effective at clearing up the eye infections, but nothing else. I was also put on a steroid inhaler that I've emptied to no avail.

In July, I got a Labcorp antibody test that came back negative, but soon after the news came out that antibodies may only last a few months, and it had been long enough for them to not show up on a test.

Now it's November and I'm still having symptoms. Basically, my cough hasn't gone away. It's definitely not as severe, but my lungs are not in the shape they were prior to the illness I had in January.

I'm a newly diagnosed asthmatic (28) who lives with her immunopromised mother (67). We don't have any other family but my sister, who lives an hour away. We facetime daily and I make the drive to her to drop off/pick up food/essentials/etc.. She requires us to tell her whenever we leave the house for essentials so that she can time (1 week) when I can drop off to her home. I currently work from home and we only go out for our weekly grocery run, doctor visits, and other essentials.

My brother in law works in a workplace that only sends the contact trace messages (she tells us it's at least once a week), but does not require any testing or quarantining. My brother in law does not believe masks fully work and my sister struggles with trusting him when he goes out by himself. My sister goes out daily (she takes all necessary precautions) to her nearest hobby and craft store while she's out for take out/groceries/essentials. Nobody in their family has been tested as there have been no symptom scares. Her neighborhood is also on the maskless side...



Recently... with the holidays and the kids' birthdaysing, we planned an indoor, in-person meeting at their home due to my brother in law taking 2 weeks vaca in a few days. We planned to isolate (or so I assumed) in our respective households and then meet the last day of his vaca so we could safely meet in person at her home. Today, my mother, the sweet lady she is, asked my sister if it would be ok to go to the grocery within the ""isolation"" period because she wanted to insure fresher ingredients for the dishes she wanted to feed my sister and the family.

It was here where we learned that our definitions of isolation were different. My sister is now irate because she ""never said she was going to isolate"" and is taking offense to me asking why she didn't mention these things while we were discussing the meeting and the vacation. Prior to today, she told my mom repeatedly that they would be home for 2 weeks. Now she is stating they will be home, but have no control over going to groceries, picking up delivery, and shopping (my biggest issue) because they can't starve or be bored.

I don't mind having different opinions as long as we can talk so we're all on the same page. I'm also a little hurt because I lost 3 people to covid this year... My sister knows this and saw how distraught I was whenever I was notified of a death... 

However, she is now defensive and refuses to even listen and is now threatening to cancel the get together. My mother is extremely stressed and sad as she thinks she shouldn’t have asked. I would love nothing better than to chew my sister out, but for the mental and emotional health of my mother, I'm hoping to be able to navigate a way for the meeting to happen safely. (We had previously suggested masks for at least just my mother and I, but was turned down as she felt her kids would be ufortable with us wearing masks indoors. A walk outside is also not an option for my mother. The last minute news of my brother in law’s vacation sounded like a blessing in disguise for us.)



Am I being rude for asking for transparency about the 2 weeks before we meet? Has anyone else had any success in navigating around defensive family members? I'd appreciate any feedback.

240,"Workplace not requiring quarantine for exposed employees Is anyone else at a workplace that doesn't require quarantine when employees get exposed to covid? We are considered ""essential"" and in the ""healthcare related field"" so therefore my employer expects employees toe for shifts even when they were directly exposed.

One of my coworkers is living with her sister who just tested positive for covid and is still expected toe to work as long as she has no symptoms (though you are contagious 48 hours before symptoms starts.) 
I'm feeling really uneasy going into work now. I feel like our whole house will be exposed and my anxiety is at an all time high. We aren't that short staffed so I'm confused why mypany doesn't require any amount if quarantine.

241,"Stressed about roomies, again. Hello once more,   


I recently posted about being really concerned about getting sick, and how anxious this situation is making me, the TLDR from lastg post is; I have an important surgerying up mid December, and I am terrfied of getting sick last minute. I feel like I am developing OCD/Health anxiety and I have stopped feeling safe in my own house, tasks that I need to keep doing like excercising and going to the supermarket have be really stressful.   


Now on top of that I feel like my roomates, who use the subway at least once or twice per week and aren't as careful as I am, are going to be the end of me. They use masks and wash their hands but then they do things that really put me on edge. They either decide to go to places like IKEA, or out of the blue invite someone (who by the way, and according to their words, was exposed, but already quarantined for 2 weeks and had a negative test afterwards) over. They know how stressed I am and how important this is for me, yet this is done casually.. I feel disappointed and like I am alone in taking care of myself.

243,"Family pressure to visit for Thanksgiving I'm a graduate student living about 2 hours away from my parents.  I've had high anxiety about the pandemic pretty steadily since early March.  Luckily, I've been able to work almostpletely remotely and only leave home for groceries and necessary errands.  I haven't seen my parents since last Christmas, but they are wanting me to visit for Thanksgiving.

My parents have not been taking the pandemic seriously.  They're both very conservative and think that COVID19 isn't nearly as bad as the media makes it out to be.  They both work in the medical field.  My mom administers and analyzes medical tests (including COVID) and my dad is an urgent care physician, but they are both fairly irresponsible about it.  They eat out, go out without masks, visit friends, many trips to the grocery store, etc. 

My sister also lives with them and is in law school.  She's also fairly irresponsible about it.  She regularly congregates with friends, eats out, attends / hosts study sessions with them.  

My dad told me last weekend that he and my mom have both recently been sick with cold-like symptoms.  But they don't want to get tested because ""If we test positive, then there will be a paper trail and we'll have to miss work.  That will cost us at least $xx amount in lost wages.""  I told him that I thought he should get tested, but just left it at that.  I think it's really irresponsible for him to not get tested when he has symptoms and is going to be around patients.  

With all of that and my recent anxiety and depression regarding the virus, I don't really feel like I should visit.  This is partly because of the risk and partly because I think it's a social responsibility to stay home if I can.  

So, I called my mom just now to tell her that I don't think I'm going to visit for Thanksgiving.  I was hoping that she would be reasonable and tell me that she understood.  She said ""Whatever.  I'm going to be really disappointed in you if you don'te.  I've really been hoping to see you.""  That made me feel bad, so I couldn't give her a definite no.  I told her I would let her know tomorrow.  

I'm not sure what I should do now.  How do I respectfully, kindly tell them that I don't feelfortable visiting?  Or should I just cave and visit them anyways? 

It's not just that I don't want to go (though that is a factor due to depression).  But I also feel that it would be irresponsible.  But I'm not sure if its worth hurting/disappointing my parents or starting an argument with them.  I don't have many people in my life right now and I don't want to alienate the few that I am still close to.  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

244,"I think I am losing my mind. This year was supposed to be exciting for me. After having a miscarriage last year, I found out I was pregnant a couple of months after. I was preparing for my baby and was excited for the baby shower in March of this year because I haven't seen my family since December 2019. Well COVID happened and it has mentally been draining. Not only was I pregnant, but I am also a nurse so it was nerve wracking.  My husband and I are alone with raising our baby who required a NICU stay during the pandemic. I was alone most of the days to visit our baby because they only allowed one visitor per day. I wanted so much for my husband to be there with me. I cried myself to sleep every night during the hospital stay. I still sometimes cry at night because of the unknown.

I am frustrated and exhausted  with taking care of my baby, work, cleaning, cooking, and being a wife. The only times I go out are to grab a grocery pick-up, get gas, go to work, and go to my baby's peds appointments. I feel like I am suffocating in my house. I am an introvert by nature, but before COVID, I frequent Barnes and Nobles or Target. It helped me relax by reading a book or looking for baby items.

I had an argument with my husband last night because I just wanted to grab a few items at Target, and escape the house without being trapped in my car. He told me that I was stupid for even thinking about it. At first, he thought I was going to take the baby with me, but I told him that I would go alone once he got off of work. I know that it is getting worse instead of better (in the US at least), but I am losing my mind.  I have had some dark thoughts in the back of my mind. I am 26 years old and I started writing my advance directive.

I am trying to stay strong for my baby. We started allowing visitors to see our baby in October. We were outside with masks on the whole time, no holding, and we were more than 6 feet apart. It was awkward, but I am glad that my child got to see the grandparents in person. We had plans to allow visits every 2 weeks alternating which households wille, but it hasn't really worked since I work nights or someone had a possible exposure. Speaking of working nights, I am miserable. Lately, I have gotten 3 hours of sleep before a night shift and started feeling light headed and hallucinating. I am looking for a day job and recently had an interview (fingers crossed). This year has truly thrown us all for a loop. Thank you for allowing me share my experience during this time.

&#x200B;

TLDR; COVID-19 ruined baby shower plans and having support during my child's NICU stay. I want to escape my house. My anxiety increased tremendously and I have started having dark thoughts. My night shift job is making me miserable to the point that I am not sleeping and starting to hallucinate.",74,0.98,k07ta8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k07ta8/i_think_i_am_losing_my_mind/,46,Support,2020-11-25,-11,178,-0.06179775280898876
245,"My experience saying NO to the in-laws for Thanksgiving week, and the aftermath of saying no For context, my wife and I both (mid 30s) live in Northern California. We recently got pushed back to the purple tier. My wifees from a big family. She has never missed a Thanksgiving with her family. Suffice it to say, their bond is super tight. I, on the other hand,e from a very small family where we didn't always have grand get-togethers every Thanksgiving, so I knew this year was going to be extra difficult for my wife.

&#x200B;

About 9 days ago, my wife's parents called her (they live about 2.5 hours away) and said one of their household members has been in contact with someone who may or may not have COVID, because that person was around someone who tested positive for COVID. We immediately cancelled our plans to spend Thanksgiving weekend at their place. It was a tough blow on my wife. Her sister from SoCal also cancelled. We'll call this sister Jen.

&#x200B;

Not long later, Jen sent my wife a text saying they might like toe up to our house for the week. Jen and her husband are in their early 30s. They have 3 kids ranging from almost 4 to about 14. This was before CA hit purple. At the time, I agreed that if they wanted to, they coulde visit us during the week of Thanksgiving break, although a part of me knew that it probably was not the brightest idea. However, Jen herself seemed hesitant; she was asking just in case. She had mentioned that they took time off work and have been experiencing cabin fever in Orange County, so maybe a few days out here would do them some good. At the time I said yes because I didn't want to be the bad guy and I figured Jen would eventually decide not toe. After all, the risks just aren't worth the rewards.

&#x200B;

The following day or so, Northern California hit purple, and we were right back to square one. Jen called and said they wouldn'te. They had made plans to visit San Francisco (and staying with us during the week). but maybe now it would be pointless as there would be even less to do with the shelter in place back in play. I was relieved.

&#x200B;

Then this past Thursday night Jen texted my wife mid-day saying she was thinking abouting. My wife talked to Jen around 9 PM Thursday and Jen basically said ""Yes, actually, we are stilling."" Because I had given Jen my blessing to visit earlier in the week, Jen took me up on my offer. So the plan was for Jen, her husband and 3 kids to stay with us from Sunday to Friday 11/22-11/27. As they were talking on the phone, my wife looked at me like ""That's OK right?"" I didn't have the heart or courage then and there to say no.

&#x200B;

So I stewed quietly in bed, processing everything.  It was bad enough that they were going toe see us for 5 days with no masks and no social distancing, but I found out that Thursday night they were going to stay at a friend's place from Friday-Sunday since that friend is on the way to our house. Thankfully, that was the final straw that broke this camel's back. I knew then that, as hard as it was, I had to shut down this deadly operation. The crazy thing was, they were already packed and ready to head to the friend's house first thing Friday morning!

&#x200B;

Therefore, I didn't have much time. Time was of the utmost essence. I laid there in bed unable to sleep. Trying to rationalize it and tell myself ""don't be a party pooper"" ""My wife misses her family dearly"" ""it would be fun to hang out and have somewhat of a normal Thanksgiving"" but I could never shut out the logical voice in my head that said, ""If you allow this to happen on your watch, someone could die.""

&#x200B;

Long story short, I ended up sending my sister in law Jen a long text at 2:45 AM, basically stating my sorrow that we can't host them this year due to the pandemic reaching all-time highs. I expressed my deepest regret that I was telling her this at the very last second, and that I ruined her plans (both she and the husband took precious time off work that they can now never get back). I also know Jen was sick of the house in SoCal, and she needed a break from home and work. I felt bad for shutting her down at the last minute, and my wife was sad too but she understood.

&#x200B;

Jen texted back at 3 AM saying it's ok, we understand. Thanks.

&#x200B;

The following day my wife sent Jen a text. We did not hear back from Jen all of Friday. That was unusual to say the very least.

&#x200B;

Then Saturday Jen responded and said sorry, she thought she sent her text. She reiterated that it was ok and that they ended up cancelling the whole trip. I was so glad to hear it. I knew the 5 of them staying with us for 5 days was too risky and a risk not worth taking. Honestly, I was shocked that they even had it in mind to visit two different households back to back. If I had allowed them to do that, if they were sleeping in our guest rooms as I type this, I would probably hate myself deeply. Sometimes you just have to put your foot down. Sometimes it's just not wise to congregate.

&#x200B;

I feel a lot better now. I'm glad I shut everything down before we could look back on this week with regret and remorse. It's now early Tuesday morning, 12:28 AM. My wife is sleeping soundly, and the house is as quiet as a mouse. I am so thankful her family isn't here. Not because I dislike hosting them -- I enjoy it -- but because the risks were too high and in the end I know I made the right decision, even as hard as it was. I have zero regrets and feel so at peace for speaking up and shutting things down before it was too late. And boy, did I cut it close. But better late than never, right?

&#x200B;

Curious if anyone has similar stories or experiences to share as Thanksgiving rapidly approaches?

&#x200B;

BTW... I now dread Christmas. I was able to shut down my wife's family for Thanksgiving, but Christmas will be the real battle. I do not feel gathering would be wise... and I think a month from now things will be even worse because of people's choices over the next handful of days. I will feel morefortable in 2021 when hopefully a proper and safe vaccine will be released to the public.",154,0.96,k019fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/k019fe/my_experience_saying_no_to_the_inlaws_for/,34,Firsthand Account,2020-11-25,-13,383,-0.033942558746736295
246,"How thorough should I actually be w/ surface cleaning/hand washing? Is it worth triggering my OCD/anxiety? So basically I work at a closed office but in a big room spanning half the floor. There are no cubicles, but we're only at 50% capacity and the employees are laid out like a checker board, wearing masks all the time. Even though the windows are closed, the AC is equipped with radiant catalytic ionization (RCI) which, according to thepany, kills 99% of viruses on surfaces and the air every hour.

Even with all that, I can't help but feel stiff and stressed out since I feel like having to use hand sanitizer every time I need to do stuff like arranging my glasses on top of my mask or drink water on my desk. Not to mention the need to clean my stuff (cellphone, wallet, glasses box etc...) with 70% alcohol when I get home.

I get that certain things really need to be cleansed, not only because of covid, like groceries. But all this cycle of putting hand sanitizer, lowering mask to drink water, putting mask back on and rearranging glasses and repeat really put my body in a state of constant stress (more than the stress I endure at work) with things like muscle stiffness and shortness of breath. With all the conflicting news regarding transmission via infected surfaces since the pandemic started, is it worth being subject to these triggers to avoid infection?

Me (25F) and my girlfriend (25F) have been dating for a year and a half now. Her grandma passed away earlier this year around April due to an illness unrelated to Covid and her uncle passed away just a month ago because of Covid. So suffice to say, she’s had a particularly rough year full of grief and loss. The only bright side is that she will be finishing school this year and she’s starting an internship in her field next week. 

My girlfriend has depression and anxiety and she’s been on medication and goes to therapy as well. This is just some background info for why she’s handling the current situation this way. She lives at home with her family and so do I. Her dad has been sick for two days (coughing and lethargy), she’s scheduled a Covid test for him today so we are now just waiting on the results. However she is not handling this well. She has been crying a lot these two days and I feel like she’s already mourning the death of her dad even though we don’t know for sure if he has Covid or if it’s just something else. Last night she cried about how she wants her dad to be at her wedding someday and now she feels like that won’t ever happen. She cried about how she doesn’t know how she’ll get thru this. I’ve done what I can, tell her things are going to be okay, to try not to think of the worst conclusions until we get the test results, and that I am always there for her.

I guess I’m at a loss of what to say now. I’ve given her advice to give her dad plenty of water and some vitamins to help ease his symptoms, but she said she’s too stressed about Covid infecting her to do anything to help her dad. Her dad has been staying in his room ever since he started feeling sick, however everyone in her household shares one bathroom because they only have one bathroom. I’m really not good at saying words offort, I prefer to show care through my actions. Yesterday I brought my girlfriend some snacks, a drink and a teddy bear tofort her.

So for background, I'm prettyfortable being in stores right now. I am able to avoid people easily and wear a thick mask, and I don't really feel ""unsafe"". I still don't feelfortable eating in public though. I'm still nervous about COVID, but my mom is very ""whatever"" about it. Last weekend, I went to the mall with my mom to do some xmas shopping. It was more crowded than I was used to, but I managed to avoid most people when walking in the mall.

My mom then asked if I wanted to eat dinner, which I said sure. Usually, when we ""eat out"" now, we get takeout and then eat it in the car to avoid eating indoors. But this time, she didn't want to do that. She found a table in the food court and sat down. I asked her if we were going back to the car, but she ignored me and asked me to go up and order for us. So I came back with the food, and she takes off her mask and starts eating. The food court was very crowded at this point, and the tables were apart from each other, but there was a ton of people walking around, trying to find tables and such. I said that I felt ufortable, and she ignored me again. I knew if I didn't eat it there though, she would get really mad at me and it would start a huge public argument, so I ate my food quickly, and I tried to keep my head down to avoid other people. 

Later that night in the car, I told her that I felt really nervous and ufortable about eating inside. She goes off on me, saying ""are you kidding me?"" She says that all the tables were far apart, so we don't have to worry. I said that it was still crowded and there was people walking by too. She says that they wore masks, so its fine. She said ""the only way you could catch COVID is if someone came up to you unmasked and talked directly to you for a couple of minutes. The people that aren't wearing masks and going to parties are the only people getting it. The ones that do everything right, like we are, aren't going to get it."" I figured it was useless to argue with her and just ended the conversation there.

I know what she said isn't true, there are good people who do everything right, who still end up with COVID.

252,"Am I being unreasonable? (Roommates) Hi everyone, 

I got into a pretty bad fight with my roommate last night. The cases in our area are very steadily increasing, and a new lockdown was recently announced. As apart of this lockdown, social gatherings aren’t allowed. 

For context, I’m young and not high risk for covid. So while I’ve been taking every reasonable precaution, I have been continuing to see my long-term boyfriend. Yesterday, my roommate told me she was no longerfortable with me seeing him as she believes he poses a risk. Her family is high risk, and she goes to stay with them for the majority of the week. So, while she’s away I have my boyfriende and stay so I’m notpletely alone (I also don’t work and do school from home, so it’s my only human interaction). Also, she works in the hospital setting so she’s (reasonably so) nervous to bring COVID to the hospital. 

I told my roommate that I thought her request was unreasonable as he is the only person I see, and the only thing keeping my mental health somewhat afloat right now. We’re both quite careful with covid. 

So, am I being unreasonable by denying my roommates request? She’s quite upset with me, and suggesting I don’t make sacrifices for her. However, I’ve been social distancing firmly out of respect for her family. She’s also involved her parents, and suggested I need to speak with them about negotiating apromise to this situation (which I am notfortable with...)

The technicians who assisted me were both wearing masks, but I am so worried that I still came into contact with it somehow through aerosols or my eyes.

254,"Just venting a bit. This is the final week of my highschool senior year. Well, sort of. We have our college admission exam in January, so we will still have classes until then. But the official school year ends this Friday.

I was just looking through last year's photos. My junior year was a blast. I was really looking foward to senior. I wanted it to be awesome, so as to finish school on a good note. 

It was ruined. No fun, 7 months of online and no graduation celebration. In a normal year, the college admission exam would already have happened (it was postponed to January). We were supposed to be happy and celebrating together, just like every class before us did.

I feel very sad, but no tears wille out. Just a strong heartburn and this terrible feeling of loss. This might not sound as important to any adults reading this; I've heard many times that highschool doesn't really matter. But, to a teen, IT IS important, it is a big deal. I'll never have another senior year, and I feel like this experience was stolen from me.

Her mom is a bartender and her dad works at a grocery store. They both wear masks at their jobs, but I’m still worried about her getting corona. Not only that, but her mom is doing a small gathering of six people at her bar on Thanksgiving, and people won’t be wearing masks since they are eating. My girlfriend also has an eating disorder that affects her a lot physically so if she got it I’m worried it could be really bad. I also am just so frustrated that because of all this I won’t be able to see her for the foreseeable future. Does anyone have any advice to cope with the anxiety?

I lost my sense of taste and smell for about 6 weeks, it was so annoying, and it gradually came back but as time passed all the way up to now, my sense of smell is still a bit ""off"" as it states in the article.

263,"Give me strength... I have no family. Ie from a really fucked up abusive background, and the only half-way decent member of my family died shortly after I reached adulthood. For most of my adult life, I’ve spent holidays alone. I’ve learned the hard way that if you’re not part of someone’s family, people just don’t really care about you and will bail on you probably 95% of the time. So for all these years, I’ve just taken care of myself. Being alone is nothing new to me, frankly.

I got a house a few years ago, and wound up next door to an older couple. And over the course of the years, through relentless effort, they sort of adopted me over time. For the last couple years, I’ve spent holidays with them. They’re the closest thing I’ve ever had to real parents (I lived with adults in a household as a child, but that does not a parent make). I really care for them, and they’ve always been there for me.

They haven’t been as serious about COVID as I’d hoped they’d be. They are both over 65, and one of them has significant respiratory issues. Their “bubble” is rather loose and oversized, and they go out more than I do. They assure me they mask up, and I’m sure they do, but I also know that masks are not an impenetrable shield. Plenty of people have gotten COVID despite being careful, and have no idea where it came from. I can’t seem to get through to them on that.

And they just did what I’ve been dreading all month. They invited me to Thanksgiving.

There’s going to be 4 other people from outside their household. It’s going to be inside. They assure me everyone is “careful,” but how careful could they be if they’re having a group of people from elsewhere in their home in the middle of a huge surge?

I know I have to say no. I’m thinking I might try to bribe them into at least having it outside by offering to buy an outdoor heater and maybe show up briefly if they do it. I know I have to say no to this. There won’t be ICU beds to put them in if they get sick and need help 2 weeks from now.

But this is probably the most heartbreaking thing that’s happened to me in the pandemic. Having to say no to the only people on earth who’ve ever actually cared about me, as far as I can tell.

And some part of me worries if I don’t go now, I won’t get to do this with them again. There’s still plenty of time for them to get COVID. And if one of them doesn’t make it, things will never be the same.

I’m caught between not wanting to miss something that is so new and precious in my life, knowing next year is never guaranteed, and not wanting to be the reason it never happens again.

* 12 hour drive. Only need about 2 or 3 stops for gas.
* Bathroom trips would be extremely limited or, hopefully in low populated places. Plenty of wipes/masks/sanitizer for those 2-3 minute trips.

Also would staying at an Airbnb for 1 night be not advised? (if I contacted the host and they didn't have anyone stay in there within the past 48-72 hours). Just in case they did not want to do highway drive and take a longer route.

What are the chances that the client could be contagious just 24 hours after exposure? From what I've gathered, it seems like that would be a low-risk time frame, which isforting, but it may help to get some input.

269,"Advice on dealing with intrusive thoughts about exposure? I started this pandemic with a baseline of mild agoraphobia, so I was already off to a bad start, lol. I was an essential worker at the start begging people to stay home, and I still am, even though no one’s classifying us as essential anymore. 

There’s a lot of factors here (mostly to do with local municipal govt and my workplace’s board of directors; we love being a county employee) that are exacerbating my issues. I’ve done everything right since the start: masked up before it was a mandate (not a humblebrag or whatever), washed my hands, kept my distance, been through the requisite 2.5plete mental breakdowns over the lack of human touch ande out of it mostly still sane. 

I’m one of the most serious employees about it at work; I don’t take my mask off except for the 10 minutes it takes me to eat lunch, I try not to get close to people, I’m admittedly over cautious and extremely paranoid). I’ve had so many exposures because of coworkers’ carelessness, and dodged the bullet every time. 

It hasn’t been to the point of disrupting my life until recently; I’ve been able to use old coping strategies to manage. But ever since that study came out of Spain detailing the transmission risk in poorly ventilated settings, I’ve been spiraling.

[trigger warning; may worsen others’ intrusive thoughts by sharing my own]
If the study showed that one masked carrier could infect 6 other masked people just by being in the same poorly ventilated room as them for four hours, then what chance do I stand of being in my poorly ventilated workspace for 8 hours if someone doesn’t know they’re sick—or with the patrons who break quarantine toe in/maskless patrons??? I’m not going to stop wearing a mask, this isn’t a discussion about that, but I’m feeling extremely hopeless and despondent.

274,"Mom was exposed, but told not to isolate or test? My husband, baby, and I moved in with my parents this summer to quarantine together. My Mom recently needed knee surgery and has been going to physical therapy three times a week since then.

Last Thursday she learned that the physical therapist she had worked with on Monday had tested positive on Thursday. But the contact tracer said that the local health department doesn't technically consider my Mom to be ""exposed"" because they were both wearing masks during the session. They told her she doesn't need to isolate or get tested. She went back to therapy the next day.

This sounded outrageous to me! The session was 45 minutes long, in a very large room with only 1-2 other patients, but at least 15 minutes of it was the therapist working in close contact with my Mom. The therapist started getting symptoms two days after the session, and I've read that you are most contagious two days before getting symptoms.

I was around my Mom Monday through Thursday morning, ate food she cooked, hugged, etc. so I am isolating for two weeks even if she isn't. I had a low grade fever for about an hour on Thursday night right after she told me the news, but otherwise no symptoms. (The fever might have just been stress-related? That would be a very fast incubation time for both of us.) 

My Mom keeps referring to the health department standards like they are infallible. She is generally cautious about the pandemic, but I feel like maybe she doesn't fully understand the risk levels and that masks don't totally prevent transmission. She was exposed at her office once before but was wearing two masks and didn't catch it, so I think that has made her put a lot of faith in the masks. I told her the information I had read, and said if I were her I would isolate and test and be a little more worried about it.

I feel like I'm over-reacting, but Fauci says that means I'm probably doing the right thing. I'm not sure how I feel about continuing to live with my Mom though since she has to go back into work soon and has so many medical appointments to go to, and the people in our area aren't taking COVID seriously at all.  It's difficult to share a home while isolating, and hard to keep my Mom away from the baby. Because I had the fever, I'm even isolating from my baby right now and it's awful to be apart from him. I'm sure this type of exposure is going to happen again as cases spike after the holidays! But I can't exactly ask her not to go to work or get essential healthcare.

Anyway, would love to hear if anyone else has heard of this ""it's not exposure if you were both wearing masks"" thing, and thoughts on keeping a bubble with people who make contact with other people more frequently than you'd like.

I was reading that the most contagious time is 1-2 days before symptoms appear, and that usually symptoms appear around 5 days after exposure. Obviously it could be longer than that, this is just what I’m seeing for averages.

277,"The media has been awful with no regards to people's mental health I know it just makes too much sense for the media to report on Covid. I mean it is a huge pandemic going on why wouldn't you cover it?  


What's frustrating and is affecting us mentally is when they keep posting numbers of cases increasing in what state, city and country. It's like everyday you tune in and you keep hearing more cases, more deaths, more hot spots, etc. Then if you aren't hearing about Covid it's something that is going on within the White House. Good lord if I have to hear another thing about what's going on with the government regarding politics I am going to lose it. I don't know how people deal with politics on a daily basis.  


There's rarely any good news nowadays. Like hearing from people that do recover from it. Lack of showing how much people have recovered or have not died from Covid. It's just really frustrating when you turn on the news and you just want to see some small news to feel good they don't want to give it to us.",122,0.87,jz23ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jz23ei/the_media_has_been_awful_with_no_regards_to/,45,Support,2020-11-23,-4,48,-0.08333333333333333

282,"Holiday travel with fiance is making my head spin TL;DR: Not sure what to do about multi-state and travel to visit my family and future in-laws. Timing is all over the place due to time off from work, quarantining, and not having our own place for the next 6 weeks. Feeling like I am being selfish about not wanting to be apart from my fiance, but I am anxious about one of us getting sick.

Back in July, my fiance and I packed up from a big city and moved out of state. We are both very fortunate to be working remotely indefinitely. We've been renting a property that is normally a vacation rental on a month-to-month basis. The owner asked if we could clear out over the holidays because of an existing reservation, and we agree. We're supposed to leave on a flight tomorrow (!) ande back in mid-January. We thought the timing would be great because we wanted to visit our family over the holidays. Both our families live in different states. We should have seen the 2nd waveing, but we didn't... If we did, we would have left earlier to quarantine before Thanksgiving.

Our original plan was to head to my parents' place (just parents and sister, so not a large gathering) tomorrow after the flight and stay for about a week. Then we would fly to his parents' and stay for a few weeks. We would plan to not leave his parents' house for 3 days, then get a test and wait for the results. His grandma lives in town and so do some of his aunts and uncles, so it's important to wait and test. After three weeks, I would fly back a bit early for Christmas, and then my fiance woulde out on Christmas day. His family is Jewish, so the holiday doesn't matter to him or them (he has told me so many times), but he does want to spend the week leading up to Christmas with his family since his mom will have time off. I have never missed Christmas with my family (I know there are probably dozens of people saying this) and I really love the holiday. In a normal year, we'd have Thanksgiving with his family and Christmas with mine.

This was definitely a harebrained scheme to begin with, but hindsight is 2020 (insert laugh/groan track here). Now we want to extend our quarantining time before seeing either family to 5 days, then test, but we are getting stuck with all the logistics. I know there is no perfect answer, but I just want to tell someone else and hear other opinions.

My feelings: I am feeling anxious about being away from my fiance. He's suggested being apart for three weeks while he visits family. I'm worried that one of us will get sick and we won't be able to see each other for many weeks. Or what if one of us has a really bad case? We are young and healthy, but you never know. In a past relationship, I was very clingy and insecure. I've matured and have been more relaxed since then, but I still worry. Am I wanting to stay with him just because of general insecurity? Or do I have good reason for not wanting to split up? I also really want to be home for Christmas like I mentioned before, but I feel bad not seeing his family for so long.

His feelings: He has some time off from work from Christmas Eve through New Year's Day. His mom works at a school and has time off the week leading up to Christmas and the week after. It's important to him to have time off with his family. Even though we have the flexibility to work remotely, it's different to actually have time off. Neither of us have seen his family since December last year. We saw my family in June. He has encouraged me to stay with my family and not travel again.

Sorry this is such a long post. I want him to prioritize Christmas with my family, but that's selfish since those are the days his mom has off work. I should probably just let my fiance go to visit his family on his own, but it makes me so sad and scared. :( Or I could skip Christmas with my family and quarantine on his schedule, but that makes me sad too. :(

My head has been spinning with all the logistics. The best thing to do would be stay here and continue to isolate. But we don't have a place to stay since the other renters still have their holiday reservation.

283,"Going home to care for COVID positive parent? Hi, I'm so glad technology exists and amunity like this exists. I'm at a loss of what to do. I'm far away from my parents right now (a few days driving distance away) and my mom tested positive for COVID. My dad is the caregiver since I'm far away but both of them are in their mid 60s.  


Here lies the dilemma: 

I don't know if it's worth going back home right now to try to convince my dad to let me help and reduce risk of transmission to him. He's the type of person that no matter what I do, he'll be worried and disapproving. I don't know if it's worth asking him if he wants me toe home or not because I already know he'll say no and be worried about me doing work remotely etc etc. However, my work is remote right now and I could go home if I wanted to and use a few sick leave/vacation days.   


I just don't know if it's worth being tested where I am, driving home, getting tested again when I get home, wait for the results, and then try to help out my parents. Part of me is worried the time it will take to be tested where I am, drive home, and test again, and then try to help, will just be a waste of time if my dad refuses to let me help, or worse if things rapidly go south and my mom is hospitalized. At that point I think even the hospital wouldn't let us inside. I also have a pet whichplicates things a bit.

284,"Husband exposed and isolated; now 5 year old vomiting On Monday, my husband was exposed at work for 7.5 hours (I put it as 12 hours incorrectly in a previous post).

No clear symptoms yet (he has gotten one mild headache, but he gets 2-3 of those a week anyway). He is getting tested on Monday (rapid antigen test).

I am living at home with our 5 and 6 year old and “working” from home. My husband is living at my parents’ vacant house around the corner since Wednesday when we heard.

My 5 year old just started vomiting an hour ago as of writing this (ed. Sunday morning). I am not sure what to do to reduce the chance of transmission if she is positive. Have her mask inmon rooms in the house? Try not to snuggle her? My google-fu is failing on this one in terms of things that are actually realistic for a 5 year old.

I guess I should get the 5 year old tested so we know.

285,"Am I Right to be Angry? Tl:dr - I work in a restaurant, indoors dining only now, and my boss is covering up and lying about covid cases that have potential to shut us down, and some people are high risk (myself included).

I’m absolutely fuming right now.  I work at a restaurant and in a state currently with more than twice our daily cases back in the spring (I’m talking thousands here).  I am considered higher risk I suppose because I have moderate to severe asthma, especially triggered by being sick, and spent a lot of time on a ventilator as a kid.  I am very cautious at work, constantly sanitizing, I wear a dual layer cloth mask with a disposable plastic/surgical mask over it to protect from customers who decide the mask mandate is optional.

My work has been lying to us about covid cases.  Some kid at my work had his dad get sick, he told me he had a fever, but then oh no he “never ended up getting sick” apparently so I was suspicious.  Well to confirm my suspicions, recently my sister’s boyfriend (me, my sister, and her bf all work at the same restaurant) tested positive, and my sister had coughed on me recently (day before he tested positive) so I was a mess of being nervous.  Tested negative, work said I didn’t have to quarantine, but my sister’s bf works almost everyday and kitchen staff DOES NOT WEAR MASKS, and servers frequently take theirs off in the kitchen or even at the freaking host desk in front of customers, so I figured a lot of people would be quarantining, no?  Nope.  Only a handful of kitchen staff is quarantining, and not a single server who worked any day with him is quarantining OR going to get tested.  And what my boss is telling us?  My sister specifically told me that he tested positive, but my boss is telling managers to spread the word that his test was “inconclusive”, and this was the lie that I was told tonight.  I immediately went to my sister about this, who is part of management, and she said that it’s to “protect workers confidentiality”, but is this really the time to be doing that???  So many people are in danger now because my work is awful about wearing masks, and what if I wind up in the hospital because they can’t be bothered?  Apparently so many people at my work don’t have insurance so my boss isn’t pushing them to get tested because they would have to pay out of pocket, and if they didn’t have the money for it he doesn’t want to pay for it.  I’m so mad because he works like I said almost everyday, so the people hees in contacte in constant with everyone else, and it’s all just one big coverup.  I don’t know if I am in the right to be mad about this, it honestly makes me scared to work here if I don’t know who is sick around me because they are being covered up.  Is this even legal?  

We don’t even follow the correct safety protocols: no plexiglass at bar but there are seats there not even 6 feet apart (less than 2 feet apart), no disposable menus (same plastic menus), staff hardly wear masks and take them off every chance they get (not even wearing good masks, a bunch of bandannas and gaiters).

286,"Coworker(s) may have exposed me. I'm afraid I may have exposed my dad, who I live with but can't deal with anymore. I wasn't nervous before. I live in a maskpliant area and cases have been really low since... May/June? They made it sound like we could control it as long as ""everyone did what they were supposed to do"" (I've noticed things that require ""everyone's"" cooperation tend not to work out very well...) So I thought we were okay.

But... the second wave is here. Now I know why they've been going on about this the whole time like it's been as bad as it was in the beginning. It's definitely moreplex than ""people not wearing masks... with the environment I work in, it seems like there's no way I can avoid getting this in one way or another.

Anyway. This girl I work with, when I made a post about her before I called her... Regina George. From that name you can imagine what she's like. There are years worth of stories with her to the point where this is absolutely no surprise whatsoever, but I'll stick to the current situation...

Regina threw TWO parties in the same week (who does that, ever?) Not just with people from work, but a bunch of random people who I have no idea who they are. She apparently didn't care what people would think to the point where she posted Facebook pics of it. I wasn't invited (which kinda bothers me cause Regina says I'm her favorite?) but I wouldn't have wanted to go anyway because a) it's a pandemic, and b) just no. Not that it makes a huge difference because those same people came right into work the next day...

Well, Regina got sent home yesterday as soon as she got there. Like I said, there are years worth of issues with her so we had no idea, but a friend of mine suggested this possibility.

Turns out... we were right! Regina had said she ""couldn't breathe"". SHE PHYSICALLY CAME IN JUST TO SAY THAT. Like you couldn't just call?! Just... WHY?!

Now she gets two weeks off (so at least some peace and quiet, lol.) But as far as I know, the managers didn't consider the possibility that several of the people we work with may also have been exposed at the party (I KNOW at least one knew about it) and thus after that when the people who were there came into work the next day.

I think I'm okay... but do I KNOW that????

On top of that, I think three(?) other people from my work who WEREN'T at the party also have to get tested due to possibly being exposed from their family. One who took off his mask the other day and got RIGHT in my face. (Though as far as I know none of them are actually sick... but my hope would be that unlike Regina, they would CALL instead of actuallying in and immediately leaving.)

So now I'm worried I could have (but probably not) exposed my almost-70-year-old father, which I only care about because my sister will blame me (also cause he's actually really healthy besides being... ""overweight"" would be putting it lightly.) Long story short, he has hit me my whole life, just sat and watched as my mom encouraged me to be sick so she could get SSI for me because ""if I said something she'd get mad at ME"", admitted when questioned that he wouldn't love me if I wasn't his biological son, hates that I'm like my mom and not him, tells me I'm an awful person even though my friends tell me I'm one of the most loving people they know (he says this is because they ""don't know the real me like he does"".)

And I'm stuck with this until who knows when. I want to get a hotel room so I just won't... risk it... but also cause I need to get away from him and cannot deal with the fact that we won't be having the holidays this year. I really really don't want to spend it with him. And we have just a few days before Thanksgiving... I just can't.

If anyone else is in a situation like this... how do you deal?

293,"WEEKLY STICKY 23-29 November 2020: Holidays, NO RANTS, and other stuff As most of you have probably noticed, over the last couple of weeks there have been increasing numbers of posts asking advice about what to do (and how to do it) over the holidays. 

There is no doubt that the safest advice over the holiday season is ""don't travel"" but we also appreciate that many people are missing their family; many people work from home, rarely go out, and may be visiting parents who do the same. Many people just want to see their loved ones, perhaps for the first time this year. 

Please do not judge people who discuss their travel plans. Do not tell them how you think they should behave (unless they ask you to), and please back up any responses you give them with why you believe their options to be safe or not - don't just say 'yes' or 'no'. Give context. 

Anyone who makes a postplaining about others' actual or intended behaviour will be removed. Anyone who makes a judgementalment in response to a post will be removed. ***Anyone breaking the rules about 'no shaming or rants' risks a ban that will last until the holiday season is over.*** 

**If you do choose to travel, do it as safely as possible:**

Think of the risks as falling into three separate sections: the risk of you being infected before you travel (to ensure you don't pass it on); the risk of you bing infected during your journey; and the risks when you arrive at the other end (the risk of you passing it on, or of bing infected yourself). 

**Before you travel:** If you can, try to stay at home for at least a week, and ideally two, before you travel. Get food and groceries delivered, only go out for walks and be as sure as you possibly can that you're not taking the virus with you. Think about who you've been in contact with over the last 10-14 days and what chance there is that they might be infected. If in any doubt, cancel your travel plans. If you do travel, be confident you're safe to do so. 

**While you travel:** Plan your route beforehand and, if using public transport or planes, try to research what precautions they take and howfortable you are that this doesn't put you at risk. Travel in your own car (or walking, if you live close enough) is safest. If using buses or trains, try to find out when it's quieter and travel at a time when it's more likely to be possible to stay more than 2m away from other passengers. Sit by an open window if possible. Wear a face covering at all times and avoid removing it to eat if you can. Try to get friends or family to pick you up from the airport/train station rather than taking a taxi. 

**When you arrive:** Think about how sure you are you're not infected. If you can't be confident, consider keeping 2m distance and wear a face covering you're inside with your family. Stay in a B&B, or with a lower risk relative for the first few days after you arrive and meet outside if possible. Try to keep family gatherings small, keep windows open where possible. Dine outside if you can.

Or if I could do them, there are so many restrictions they are just not worth doing because the restrictions take all the enjoyment away--not mention that I wouldn't feel safe anyway.

I'm retired, so don't work.  I live with my husband and am not a social person so the lack of social interaction isn't a huge deal.  The friends I have don't live in my area so we keep in touch by email, as we always have.  Can't go to the gym, can't go to the garage sales and thrift stores, can't shop for some much-needed items of clothing because nothing can be tried on in the store, and I don't like online shopping. I  can't enjoy a dinner out with my husband.  The few things I could do away from the house are all things I don't enjoy and don't want to do, so what's the point in doing them.

297,"Possibly losing the few things that have gotten me through this so far. I don't know what to do. I was not doing well at all for the first few months of the pandemic. I was honestly pretty muchpletely hopeless and suicidal for a while. I still hate not being able to go most places or see people normally, but as time has gone on, I've found things that make it easier. I've been able to do my regular job from home and also had a temp job on top of it that was taking up a lot of my time for a while, I'm taking some online classes, and I've been sewing masks and helping deliver food and supplies for some of the local food pantry/mutual aid organizations in mymunity. Being fairly young (mid-30s) and healthy (as is my partner, whom I live with and who is the only person I've interacted with without masks and distancing since March), and also participating in one of the vaccine studies, I figure that if someone has to be out making sure people get necessary supplies, better I do it than someone who's at more risk, and it's a way of getting the time outside my apartment that I would more than likely have been dead months ago without.

The last few months I've been going for walks and runs outside, and meeting up with a few friends occasionally (always 6+ feet apart, with masks on the entire time, and outdoors) to do things like hiking and walking. Both the exercise/outdoor time and getting to see people has made a HUGE difference in whether I could even imagine surviving the rest of this. Since everything I've heard in terms of research seems to show that masks and being outside, especiallybined, make it pretty rare for COVID to spread, I felt confident in continuing to do this as long as neither I nor anyone I was meeting up with had good reason to quarantine or self-isolate beyond just regular social distancing protocols (i.e. none of us were sick or had been exposed to someone who was sick). In my area the current rules allow us to get together with a few people at a time from different households as long as it's outdoors with distancing and masks, but we also just got a curfew because cases have gone up (mainly to prevent people from having indoor parties). I also live in an area where we have decent weather all year, so I was looking forward to being able to keep doing this the next few months.

Now I'm seeing more and more people say that not even this kind of thing is safe, and a lot of posts on social media to the effect that anyone who isn't staying home altogether aside from absolute necessities, or who is seeing anyone they don't live with at all, is selfish and horrible. Any outdoor time/socializing I've been doing has been following public health rmendations, and so I think I'm more afraid of people thinking poorly of me than of it actually posing any significant risk, but I'm still thinking about cutting even these things out because I get the sense they're not OK to do anymore and maybe never were in the first place. My partner and I had been planning to do a one-night camping trip with another couple next week (close friends we regularly go on walks/hikes with who are basically on the same page we are in terms of risks, and we would have also been in separate campsites and meeting up during the day to hike/walk with masks and distancing). Now I'm not at all looking forward to it because I feel so guilty about it, and am probably going to end up canceling. No matter how much it's been helping or how small of a risk it is...most people I know have given up so much more than I have, even though it's been obviously at a huge cost to their own mental and physical health, and maybe I should be willing to do that too. I feel like I've been irresponsible, and like the few things that were helping me get through this are gone, and I'm angry at myself for havinge to rely on them in the first place instead of just...I don't know, sucking it up like everyone else seems to be and forcing myself to get through the next few months, no matter how hard that is.",4,0.83,jz1x2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jz1x2h/possibly_losing_the_few_things_that_have_gotten/,1,Support,2020-11-23,-7,195,-0.035897435897435895

310,"Lack of social interaction is starting to get to me... I've always had difficulty making friends. As a kid, I spent most of my time with my mother and didn't really get the chance to be socialized properly, and that along with then-undiagnosed ADHD and OCD made me a bit of a loner. I was bullied pretty badly from 4th to 8th grade, and arguably after that, being stuck with a group of ""friends"" that didn't really want much to do with me but kept me around as a punching bag. In college I entered a ""clique"" led by a narcissist which turned abusive and kicked me out in September of 2019. I've been pretty much alone, rarely socializing, ever since.

At the beginning of this year, I had aplete mental breakdown from how empty my life was and finally sought treatment for my issues. Then COVID happened. I came home for spring break and never left. Since I have terrible anxiety, especially surrounding illness, and wasn't really socializing to begin with, staying home wasn't much of a big change for me. But now it's been almost 9 months of COVID isolation, on top of the 6 months of friendless isolation before that. And I'm starting to go stir-crazy.

311,"Would distancing in the house like this be safe? Hello!

I'm having a bit of a covid scare; I may have had an unconfirmed exposure. I'm currently staying with my dad (60's) and grandma. I know I'm probably fine, but I'm quite anxious about it and for the sake of my family's safety I'm planning on staying in my room (with my dad leaving food and stuff outside my door, and I have my own bathroom) and getting tested in 5 days (since I read that 5 days is the best time to get tested after potential exposure??)

Basically the house is fairly big, and two stories. There is a loft area on the 2nd floor that overlooks the living room (so the living room has a high celing). Because I'm only staying with them for a short time, my dad suggested that (as a work around so we could still see each other's faces) I could ""have dinner"" with them by eating in the loft, while my dad and grandma eat down below. So we'd be seeing each others faces but be well over 6 feet. (Between the lateral and height difference, I'd say it's like 10-20 ft, and the area is very open so the ventilation isn't tight?) I know it's safest to just stay in my room and not leave, but for what it's worth I guess this is the only place I know to ask if that would be ok?? Would eating that far from them be relatively low risk, or should I shut it down and stay in my room? Alternatively, would it be ok if I sat there and just read a book or something with my mask on?

My dad also suggested that we could go on walks outside (both wearing masks.) I said no for now, but I wanted to also ask here how risky people think this would be? And should I be worried about COVID particles getting thru vents or door cracks?

(I know I should have been more careful and visiting family right now is questionable, and I 100% accept my responsibility and fault in that. I guess I'm just here to ask if there's a way that I can take advantage of the house's layout, and can feel that we're spending time together without putting them at risk?

320,"I'm positive, but I'm also positive. As the title suggests, I (31M) tested positive as of Wednesday night, just hours after learning that my 6-month-old niece tested positive and about 24 hours after learning my mom tested positive. I haven't seen my mom since Saturday, and I honestly don't remember the last time I saw my niece.  


While the nurse who shared the news felt bad, she seemed relieved in that I'm borderline asymptomatic and that I should be out of the woods in about two weeks as should my mom and niece. The only symptoms I'm experiencing at the moment are a little sinus congestion and a runny nose. The other day it was a bit of a scratchy throat. Overall, the past 48 hours have been a little reflective.

1. The timing is a good thing, as I'd still have the antibodies during the ramp up period to distribute the vaccines. I do intend on donating the antibodies to those in need. If anyone can direct me to who to contact for doing so, I'd greatly appreciate it.
2. My mom worked in food safety in nursing homes when I was growing up, so the hand washing has been ingrained in me. Despite that, the social distancing, the masks, the cleaning of surfaces, etc. we still got it. Be as vigilant if you can. If you have the same fate, takefort in knowing that you did everything to minimize your exposure within reason and being covid-19 positive might mean a milder case than otherwise.
3. It's not healthy in playing the blame game on who started it. It serves no other purpose than to create tension and add unnecessary stress when your overall objective is to keep your immune system up as best you can to fight the virus. It may forever be a mystery on how my mom and I got it. We think my niece probably got it from my mom, but I digress. We like to think she will get some good immunity growing up and this will only be a memory for her via storytelling.
4. I am doing the impromptu candle and orange juice test every morning. I sniff a candle to test my smell, and drink my orange juice for my taste buds. If I can taste the OJ, great. if not, at least I'm getting some vitamins my body needs.
5. Eating raw garlic helps boost the immune system. Just a clove a day is all you need. Sounds crazy, but it's been proven to do so. I tried it years ago when I had the flu and it worked wonders. You will need a chaser, and I don't rmend eating it on an empty stomach.

I took off mask only briefly (a minute or less).

329,"How to get sleep when anxious about Covid? Hello!
I’ve been having difficulties sleeping at night due to my anxieties around Covid. 

Back in July, my boyfriend and his entire family had caught Covid. He has an uncle who thought the whole thing was a hoax so he never practiced any safety measures. Everyone has keys to one another’s houses, and it wasmon for them to visit one another freely. So as a result, even family members that never left the house (elderly grandparents, children) got sick. 

I won’t go into detail but the whole experience was awful. His whole family is normally a really rowdy bunch, and for several weeks the whole family was stricken. Some suffered more than others but overall, everyone ended up okay.

I guess that’s when the sleeping problems really started. My boyfriend and his dad actually got the worst of it and I can’t really get the mental image of how sick he was out of my head. (I used to “visit” from outside the house.) He used to call me when he felt scared from not being able to breathe well and even though I supported him through the experience, it was really jarring. The idea of not being able to breathe or the sensation of smothering is extremely terrifying to me. I wanted to be there for him so I pocketed the feelings, but it was difficult to have those conversations on the phone.

I have GAD and OCD and I was actually managing it very well until this experience happened. I had nightmares for a few months following their recovery, but even though those have stopped, I can’t convince myself to fall asleep. I’m worrying that either him or his family will get sick again, that I could get sick and experience what he experienced, or my own family members getting sick and having to go through that. 

I’m frustrated that I can’t seem to talk to anybody in my circle about it (friends, family) because they think I’m  overreacting to the situation. I’ve spoken to a therapist about it, and even though it’s nice to have someone nonjudgmental to talk to about it, I haven’t figured out a way to confront the problem.

It’s hard to describe, but the difficulty doesn’t entirely lie in the fact that I can’t fall asleep, it’s more like I’m too worried/afraid to wake up in the morning to the news that someone I know has it and isn’t doing well. Or that I may feel sick upon waking up. I wake up in a panic, but when I realize everything is okay, the rest of the days goes on smoothly. But then it’s like that everyday... wake up panicking, winding down throughout the day, then struggle to fall asleep (until I eventually fall asleep from pure exhaustion.) I really miss the stability of a normal sleep cycle. 😣",25,0.94,jxrohr,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jxrohr/how_to_get_sleep_when_anxious_about_covid/,13,Questions,2020-11-21,-27,141,-0.19148936170212766
330,"Imagining Symptoms? How to ease my mind?? So I don’t know how to ease my mind about this. Since the pandemic started I’ve always had this thing where I just make up covid symptoms and assume that it’s the end and that inevitably have it.

332,"Having to Skip Thanksgiving This Year Has Made Me (14, M?) Incredibly Sad Aside from Hanukkah, Thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday. I love Thanksgiving food so much. I love every single bite. I love spending time with my family. November has always been my favorite month, and simply being inside on a chilly, sunny Thanksgiving day surrounded by my paternal family eating wonderful food (seriously, everyone in my family is an amazing cook, fucking props to Aunt Geri holy shit) feels incredibly cozy andforting. My most cherished memories are of eating Thanksgiving and watching TV in my aunt's living room with my cousins and father afterward.

I also have a ritual for the Saturday following Thanksgiving. I lay down and watch Mumkey Jones' video [The Wheel of Punishment]( sit at myputer desk and watch [Illymations]( and then eat pizza at this nice pizzeria near my home with my father (I know, it's bizarrely, problematically specific, but I have Asperger's and people like myself tend to rely on very specific routines.)

Thanksgiving is a staple of the year for me. It's ingrained as a highlight of our yearly traditions, and I've always gotten sad at the thought of skipping out on this wonderful, blissful holiday. And now, because of COVID-19, and because my uncle Andy and grandmother are both high-risk individuals, I can't enjoy this tradition, as I could be giving them COVID-19, which could very well kill either or both of them. My other relatives are having a Thanksgiving feast, but, as much as I desperately wish I could participate, I and my father have chosen to skip out to protect his mother and brother.

It's awful. I feel like crying because I love Thanksgiving, and I'm unable to observe it this year. Thankfully, Fauci says life should largely return to normal in or around April 2021, which ensures I'll be able to observe it next year, but like, I'm missing out on my 14th Thanksgiving. My 14th Thanksgiving will take place when I'm 15, and that doesn't feel right.

333,"Move cross country during a pandemic? My wife and I live in Dallas and I started a new job over the summer based in Massachusetts, but have been working remotely. In normal circumstances we would’ve relocated over the summer, but cases were high in Massachusetts at the time, then they were high in Texas and we decided to hold off and see how things go. Everyone at my newpany is working remotely so there is no rush to get there. They understand the situation and are fine with us not being there right away. In September we decided we will make the move over Christmas  and have everything set up – movers, apartment lease, utilities, etc. Given the current situation with COVID we are debating whether or not to delay our move. Our reasons to delay include decrease our risk of exposure while in transit, if we were to get in an accident (it is winter, afterall) and hospitals are full, and if we have any issues traveling through states (borders closed? Need COVID tests?). For the last one, it is hard to predict what restrictions will be like a month from now when cases are predicted to be even higher post-Thanksgiving. Our reasons to continue with the move over Christmas is we’ve already put money down on an apartment and would have to pay a fee if we break the lease and we were hoping to get a feel for the area over spring and buy a house during the summer. I work in a university, so I’d like to start the next school year fresh in a new home and hopefully things are somewhat back to normal.

For many months the facility managed to get extremely lucky and testing kepting back negative across the board, week after week. Staff and residents get tested 2x a week.

Well that shit went up in smoke a few weeks ago and the virus snuck in and ripped through us like wildfire and we've since lost several residents and virtually the entire facility is now a red zone.

I started feeling run down 4 or 5 days ago and a bunch of symptoms emerged: sore throat, flu-ish chills and body aches, intermittent low fever. And then yesterday, seemingly out of nowhere, I realized I couldn't taste any element of the casserole I was eating. Like, nothing. 

Needless to say my most recent test came back positive. I live in a tiny house with my wife and two children. I have no way to protect them. I can't afford to live out of a hotel. There's no basement or spare bedroom that I can even attempt to quarantine in. My wife reported my positive to her employer and she's getting a rapid test tomorrow but will be unable to work for at least a few days.

339,"Need advice on situation of post Covid care of grandparent with family My brother(a nurse) got the virus from work and then gave it to his son who then spread it to my grandpa since his son spends time at both their houses. This happened about a month back and it's left him in a heavilypromised state that required hospitalisation. However, he's back home and we as a family along with home health and other professionals are in a long road trying to help nurse him back to health.

Within our family, it is mainly me, my sister, my brother, and my brother's son that are with him as he requires 24hr attention. When we are with my grandpa, we make sure to wear masks at all times to protect each other as well as my grandpa.

My problem is with my brother and his son however. His son often goes out to bars and other high risk places, but nobody besides me wants to call him out on this. To add to it, he has problems with sleep apnea and they want him to start using his CPAP at night when he's with my grandpa. 

Now, from my research, it appears that the risk of transmission to others increases greatly when a person uses these machines. I've brought this up to my brother, but he just says ""I checked into that and he doesn't have covid so there's very little risk.""

I heavily disagree though. My nephew isn't being tested and coupled with the fact he goes these types of places, I see a huge risk to me and everyone else. So I'm suggesting that I don't want my brother's son staying with him at night.

But the problem is, nobody wants to listen to me. Everyone including my grandpa don't really want to understand the facts. Whenever I make a point about a precaution we should take, I always get pushback with, ""it's not that serious"" or ""you're over thinking it"".

341,"how to quarantine if you spouse has potentially been exposed? I'm hoping some folks have been in this position and can provide some advice to me and maybe others.

I got the call from my boss last night; one of my immediate coworkers has a sibling (they live with) that tested positive, asymptomatic, and coworker is going to get tested. I think their sibling got tested because someone they work with was sick, but I may have misunderstood. the first thing I do after the call is put my mask on and wash my hands. I'm at home with my wife, its just us two that live together. I tell her one of the coworkers on my 3 person team is sick. We avoid being onsite as much as possible but I had to work one day with them this week, 2 days end of last week.

So, our reaction is to be as safe as possible and then decide what's best. I set up the air mattress, wear a mask, wash my hands, disinfect everything. We eat dinner at the other side of the room. we have different work from home offices so we can stay apart today. oh, and tomorrow is our anniversary.

Its a lot of work to stay apart when you live with each other. its hard to process stress when you can't hold your partner. Since my last contact with my coworker (yesterday afternoon) I have kissed my wife and shared food (before getting the call), so does it even matter if we quarantine from each other? if there's any small benefit then we'll do what it takes, but does the work outweigh the toll it takes? If I wear a mask will it reduce the potential viral load she could pick up? could her system fight it off easier? last night we were about to say screw it and just quarantine together, but decided we should look into it more. There's just not that much out there for something this specific, so I was hoping some others have been hear before and could give me advice.

work info: I worked with my coworker for approximately 12 hours in the last 2 days, she has no symptoms, neither do I. We all wear masks (I have a nicefortable 3 layer cotton mask) and try to keep a distance, but we are within 6 feet of each at times, probably less than 10minutes of that time per day, but also probably within 12 feet of them for several hours per day. Their sibling is in their bubble so they don't wear masks at home, so it seems likely my coworker will test positive. I'm more optimistic about the space i've kept between us.

health info: My wife and I are early 30s and healthy, and she doesn't have any physical conditions that put her at a higher risk.

plan at this point: both of us quarantine at home, and I quarantine from her, until we hear if my coworker tests positive, which is likely. I may go get tested today, but guidelines say that if I'm asymptomatic and with my level of exposure, I should wait 5 days to get tested to avoid a false negative. testing sites near me are booked out to December, but one near me has non-reservation availability I could drive up to.

TLDR: my immediate coworker lives with someone who tested positive. Is it worth it to quarantine (within our home) from my spouse if we have already spent the evening with each other? regardless neither of us are leaving the house.",2,0.75,jxt9ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jxt9ei/how_to_quarantine_if_you_spouse_has_potentially/,2,NA,2020-11-21,0,187,0

I made sure to quickly get away from them after it happened so wasn't hanging around.

346,"A bad year, even without COVID. Completely devoid offort. This time last year I was celebrating a year of sobriety, a year free of a crappy relationship, six pack abs  and a 50 lb weight loss, a pretty decent group of friends/activity partners, and I had a living cat. After my banner year of getting it together, I am almost in awe of where I am now.

I broke my foot running in July and it never healed; I had surgery on it and still can't walk. My friends are busy parents, juggling homeschooling kids, etc. or were mountain biking/gym friends, and I am in a wheelchair now, basically. My other friend group of former drinking buddies had also somewhat gotten it together, but reverted to hanging out with my ex boyfriend when I couldn't raft and hike after I broke my foot (middle school or am I a 37 year old woman?!).

My cat just dropped dead off of the ottoman on Halloween.

I'm still sober, I'm employed from home, and I have somehow managed to still sort of workout with one leg these past few months, but hardly Crossfit and mountain biking... My addiction replacements. This has really triggered an obsessive eating disorder and body hatred I had at least managed for years. I have to eat so little in order to maintain the weight loss while not able to walk. I'm just sitting alone in my house watching my body deteriorate, inputting calories and protein into an app so my stupid foot might someday heal.

I know it could be so much worse but it's taking every bit of mental strength I have to get up every day, work, and do 1 legged pushups and look at my baby leg and flab... and talk to myself. I can't even go adopt another pet because I can't walk or drive. And I feel like I can't ask anyone (all two of my remaining friends) for help orpany because they are overwhelmed and don't need another child to take care of right now.

348,"I just want this to end. A little less than a month ago, I made a post on here expressing a need for support during this COVID crisis (Link: [ I really appreciated everyone's feedback, and the resources that were provided have been really helpful.

With that said, a lot has changed since I wrote that post. I learned 4 days later that my grandmother passed away suddenly (not COVID-related), and I ended up going home (I currently live on a college campus) to be with my parents for a few days while we all processed this loss. My parents and I all take this COVID crisis seriously (my parents have rarely left the house since March, and I rarely hang out in-person with others - on the rare occasion I do see friends in-person, I consistently wear a mask and stay 6 feet away, and request the other person do the same).

I regularly had suicidal thoughts during the months prior to my grandmother's passing as a result of the ongoing COVID crisis and mental health issues/low self-esteem that began shortly after my grandfather passed away in September 2019. Since my grandmother's passing, though, my mind has been in a ""purgatory"" state of not wanting to die (both for myself and knowing how much pain my family would be in), but also having an especially difficult time getting through each day, and really looking forward to the day I can go home with my family for the holidays and not be alone on campus anymore (I moved back on campus this semester partly because of how hard it was to stay home 24/7 for 5 months with a mom who gets angry/yells easily and partly because being on campus has helped my mental health and academic motivation, but my only roommate just fully moved out yesterday for a co-op she'll be pursuing during Spring 2021, and I really want to go home and not be alone in my apartment anymore due to how much of a toll my grandmother's passing has taken on me).

Now the CDC ising back and saying that people who haven't been living with you for the past 14 days should not visit home for Thanksgiving, meaning they strongly encourage college students to stay on campus during the holidays. I know the CDC means well, and I understand why they rmend this, but tbh this isn't realistic for me or for a lot of college students. My college will be shutting services down during the break, and they've been encouraging college students currently living on campus to go home and stay home during the Thanksgiving break, through finals, and during the December/January break - I just got my last weekly COVID test yesterday, and am currently self-isolating in my apartment before going home for the break on Saturday. I plan to stay home until the beginning of Spring semester in January (I'm very fortunate that my parents' house is only 30 minutes away from my college).

Not to mention that I would likely be encouraged to go home temporarily if a 4-6 week lockdown is put in place during the Spring 2021 semester anyway, and while I'm not opposed to this, it just seems super contradictory to what the CDC is saying now regarding Thanksgiving.

Even with this knowledge that I'm making the only choice that seems realistic for me, and even with me and my family taking this seriously, it's hard not to feel miserable when multiple news sources are trying to make me feel like a horrible, selfish person for making this decision, especially when it feels like the culmination of nearly a whole year of college students being solely blamed for the ongoing crisis (I know there are plenty of college students not taking this as seriously as it needs to be taken, but this sadly applies for all age groups, not just college students).

I'm not sure how I'd cope if I have to deal with this COVID crisis and these necessary COVID-related restrictions again next school year, and I really, really hope theing vaccines make it so next school year is significantly better for everyone, especially since I still need to take multiple lab/project-based STEM classes before graduating in Spring 2022.",19,0.95,jx9pz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jx9pz7/i_just_want_this_to_end/,8,Support,2020-11-20,-14,259,-0.05405405405405406
349,"Seeking advice: Goals, routine, hobbies in the time of COVID Hi everyone! I am one of the (many, it seems like after spending some time here) single people in their mid-twenties who lives alone far from family and friends. I struggle with anxiety and depression normally, so obviously COVID has been hell for me and totally ""ruined"" most of the good things I had going in my life.

I know we probably have at least a few more months of isolation, but I'm really reaching my breaking point.

So here is why I am looking for advice: I am really trying to add some structure back into my life and bulk up my mental health toolbox. I would love thoughts and suggestions on any of the topics below:

\- What kinds of goals have you set during corona times? How do you stay motivated about life?

\- How have you kept a routine even with abundant free alone time and not much to do?

\- How have you fostered a sense of connection to ovee being isolated?

\- What are some new hobbies I could get into that would take up a lot of time or connect me with other people?

\- Any suggestions for safe volunteer opportunities?

\- Any suggestions for ""side hustle"" kind of things to make money?

\- Any suggestions for positive people to follow on social media related to self-growth or oveing anxiety/depression or positivity?

350,"Anyone have good experiences with flying during this pandemic? I'm a college freshman who's on campus right now and plans to return home for winter break. I'm a couple hundred miles away from home and without a car, so I have chosen to fly. With cases rising in the US though, I don't feel as sure about going back anymore. I plan to wear two masks and maybe a face shield and wear that all throughout my travel until I get back home, but I'm still worried. I presumably got Covid less than 2 weeks ago now so I supposed that could offer me some protection, but I've heard stories of people getting long haul Covid somehow or having a worse second infection due to being exposed to Covid again. I'm also generally anxious about the uing holiday season because I am very sure that my family is going to go on with holiday dinners as normal which I'm angry with. I know vaccines areing out soon, but I feel like it's gonna take some time to see things get better when ites to that. So in the meanwhile there is still much time for Covid to get even more horrific in the US. There's just so many unknowns and it's so hard to deal with it sometimes.

I have thought about staying on campus over winter break but I'm deterred from it for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the backlash from my family is likely to be intense. My family is basically all anti-maskers who think Covid is overblown so I predict they're gonna berate and gaslight the shit out of me if I try to stay away. Then, my campus is closing over break so if I wanted to stay, I'd have to give a pretty good reason and I'd have to pay to get groceries to eat.

I always sanitize my hands, use my face mask properly, don't linger too long... we couldn't have been speaking for more than ten minutes. However, her mask was down below her nose and I couldn't help but wonder, how is this still somon? Surely by now people know that masks need to be over the nose?  


I don't want to be a soccer mom or randomly chide anyone, but it's taking a lot of effort for me to not straight out tell strangers to pull their masks up. I know it's rude but it's also a public health thing. How is everyone else dealing with this? I barely want to talk to people at all in public anyway, but there's a growing part of me that's getting tired, I miss my friends so much and this year has been terrible and from what I understand a mask under the nose is effectively useless?",11,0.82,jx20ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jx20ah/is_it_bad_form_to_tell_strangers_to_pull_their/,11,Support,2020-11-20,-7,68,-0.10294117647058823
360,"Paranoid that I have COVID i've been having pretty bad anxiety about the pandemic ever since march, and now that i'm back at university it's only been getting worse. i try to be as careful as possible by only interacting with my roommates, wearing a mask in public, social distancing, etc., but something happened that has made my anxiety really skyrocket.

the other day i had to go get my car checked out by a mechanic, which i thought was only going to take half an hour to an hour, but i ended up waiting over 3 hours in the cold. i wandered around town sitting on various benches on the street and trying to avoid other people, some of whom were not wearing masks, but at a certain point it just got too cold to stand, so i made my way to a local restaurant. there were only a few people there, not more than 6 or 7 total. i ordered something small and sat down at a booth. the restaurant had closed off every other booth so that people were not sitting close to each other, so i was at least 6 feet away from anyone else that might've been there. i took my mask off for maybe about 5 minutes to quickly eat, put it back on, waited another 5 minutes so my legs could thaw out some more, and then left.

this situation, coupled with the fact that i had to interact briefly with the mechanic (inside from 6 feet away, both of us were wearing masks) has left me paranoid that i was somehow exposed and will be sick. i'm really trying hard not to overthink, but every time i sense something in my body (a shiver, a small cough) my mind goes to the worst case scenario. if anyone has any advice for dealing with this kind of anxiety, or just some reassurance, it would be much appreciated.",2,0.67,jxa9e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jxa9e6/paranoid_that_i_have_covid/,3,Support,2020-11-20,-10,95,-0.10526315789473684
361,"Terrified of getting sick right now Hello Everyone, I hope you are all doing well and staying safe during these times.

I have a bit of a situation that is driving me crazy recently; I have a scheduled surgerying up on December and as the date gets closer I find myself acting more and more paranoid about getting sick (Obviously, if I get sick last minute it will have to be postponed and it's a corrective surgery I have waited for for years, so it's super important for me). I personally take a ton of care since march, I have only really gone out for walks/cycling, to the supermarket, or any doctor apt I might have, and this is okay, but lately I find myself disinfecting everything even inside the apartment, avoiding touching even cuttlery or surfaces if I think they might be infected, and I have been washing my hands a lot more. I live with two other roomates and I have been trying to keep my distance but of course this is impossible at times; they fortunately wear a mask and follow rules as much as possible, but they expose themselves more than I do pared to me, they need to go to their respective offices once or twice per week, and they are a lot more relaxed about it (e.g. they don't shower immediately aftering back home from their office/using the subway/the supermarket)). I am terrified of the situation going south closer to the date; to be fair I have talked with them and they will cut down going out even more when December starts, but I am still very much freaking out and worrying all the time. Whenever I hear a sneeze or a cough I can't help but to expect the worst and I have been on this loop since November started.. it is really draining me and I wonder if I am exaggerating..

TLDR; I have an important surgerying up, and I am terrfied of getting sick last minute. I feel like I am developing OCD/Health anxiety and I have stopped feeling safe in my own house, tasks that I need to keep doing like excercising and going to the supermarket have be really stressful and I don't know how to cope..

i'm from germany and especially a region where enough people around me aren't taking this problem seriously enough. i think i'm one of them and i hate it.

i'm keeping the distance, am very cautious with meeting people at all (not even my family) and am masking whenever i'm afraid i could encounter people randomly without enough distance, but situations such as a couple of hours ago just make me look like a (cov-)idiot.

look: i saw my ~50y.o. neighboring through the door, we greeted each other and i'm stupid enough to walk towards the door so there wasn't any distance basically. i was masked, he wasn't.
it's not the first time i'm acting in a slightly unprincipled manner and it's always happening for a very short time, not that i'm partying without masks and such. i think it's because my inner self says i'm looking like an alien to all these people not taking covid so seriously.
 
so i feel like betraying my own principles and i hate myself even to the point of feeling as if i deserve the punishment of celibate and anhedonia. and even when i don't hate myself because of such a bad, inconsequent behavior, i feel the need to hate myself. but when i hate myself i feel a loss of integrity and guilty conscience because i feel like someone who's killing someone atleast somewhere.

365,"Husband exposed; any rmendations? Hi everyone,

We just heard yesterday afternoon about the positive test result for one of my husband’s coworkers. He was in a smallish room with her for 12 hours on Monday with surgical masks on. She was fairly early in her symptoms (AKA close to maximum infectiousness). So my guess is that there is very approximately a 50% chance that he got infected.

We are incredibly lucky: my parents have a second home around the corner that they aren’t living in. So I asked him to go live there for X days. I’m not sure what X is. We are relatively young (35 and 37) and have two little kids. I guess X should be 14, but that sounds very painful with these kids and the expectation that I continue to work full time from home. (Obviously, if he gets symptoms and/or a positive test result, X will be whatever the mediCal rmendation is. I think it’s end of symptoms plus 3 days?)

I opened all the windows and turned box and exhaust fans for 2 hours. Then I went around and sanitized handles and stuff.

I gave him a humidifier and will be running our two others 24/7 except for sanitization.

Anything I’m missing? Rmendations about the value of X? With the reality of my husband’s job and living in the mountain United States where Covid is verymon right now, I think it’s more likely than not that he will be exposed again, potentially multiple times. So, isolating him in this way for 2 weeks at a time regardless of negative test results (he hasn’t been tested yet) would be pretty hard on my mental health. And, he works in (remote) patient care at a hospital, so quitting is a moral quandary.

The cough was so mild (and actually fake sounding) we don't want to get the ""brain swab."" No one else in the household has be sick, and she's coughed in my face a few times.

382,"Am I Still Safe to Go Home? I am planning to visit my sister over Thanksgiving, but she received a bone marrow transplant 10 months ago, so she is heavily immunpromised. Because of this, I have been strictly quarantining (not leaving my house) since last week to make sure I am safe to visit her. I will be taking a mail-in COVID test as well just for reaffirmation.

Yesterday, after a virtual doctor's appointment, I was prescribed some medication, and I had to pick it up at a nearby pharmacy. Their drive-thru is usually open, so I thought it would be safe enough to pick up. But this time, their drive-thru was closed, and I had to enter the building. I waited until I thought the place was empty of customers, and I went in. I was the only customer in there until the very end. I was in there for less than five minutes, and everyone was wearing masks. The pharmacists were also behind a plexiglass wall. This was much more social exposure than I would have preferred, and now I'm getting quite anxious about it, especially because of my sister.

385,"Anyone have any good news to brighten up this horrible depression? Hi all..Like many of you I'm going through a really tough time and looking for some hope to cling on to. I've suffered depression throughout my life, but this is somethingpletely different that I'm wholly unequipped to deal with and I'm not sure how to go on anymore. It all seems so meaningless and I feel so utterly lost.

I feel like I've lost nearly everything. I got my masters degree over a year and a half ago and to celebrate decided to work in Japan for a year with my boyfriend. I was mostly treated like shit and couldn't wait to get back home and make something of myself. I've always lived life with a plan or something to hold onto and I've been so fortunate with a lot of the opportunities that havee my way. However, once covid came it was like everything just fell apart.

I've been jobless for eight months and I've lost track of all my applications, never been called into an interview a single time. I've applied to nearly everything, just to have something to do and some form of ie. Even jobs that I used to have as a student won't take me, either because of over-qualifications or because they're suffering because of covid as well.

Right now I'm living at my grandmothers, which I'm really thankful for but basically living off savings which I worked really hard to increase in order to invest in an apartment, or even eventually move overseas to live with my boyfriend who's from Australia (we've been together for a little over two years). Of course, my boyfriend and I were separated because of covid and I haven't seen him in eight months either. I probably won't see him until late 2021, when eventually we get vaccines in order and borders start to open (if we even manage to keep this monotonous virtual relationship alive, that is).

My parents are in America (I live overseas) and I can't see them either due to health-insurance reasons and them being in the ""at-risk"" group. I miss them a lot, and this will be my first Christmas and birthday that I haven't spent with them.

Besides this and most importantly, I lost my other grandmother in August and recently my dog, who was my best friend and biggest support through this. I've been especially crushed after this, like it was some kind of finishing blow.

We're going through a big lockdown now, so I haven't seen my friends in awhile and its hard to talk about all this. They're all studying or have jobs and no one can really relate to what I'm going through, as they all have their loved ones nearby and some purpose. It just feels like everything is getting harder and harder, like I'm trying to run in mud and I can't do it anymore. I wake up every day and feel dead, I barely eat and it's not like I can go outside and do things so I just lay in bed every day. I find no joy in my old hobbies anymore, either.

I've been working three volunteer jobs in order to try and stay relevant in the job market, but this is draining me as well and I feel like I can't do a good job. I feel like they're just using me for free labor, especially since I don't exactly get any perks except for not having a gaping hole in my resume.

I know that it's amazing that the vaccine is being pushed this fast and I'm definitely going to take it, but other than this I don't know what to hold on to. It's one thing to push through another two or three months, but I don't know if I can handle another six, or even a year, until things start to return to normal. I just want to live again and feel something. I'm so tired, people say to hang in there and that good things will eventuallye, but how long do I have to keep this up? Nearly everything good in my life is gone and it seems to just get worse and worse

Does anyone have any tips or good news to give? It would be appreciated so much...",15,0.95,jw4dbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jw4dbr/anyone_have_any_good_news_to_brighten_up_this/,10,Support,2020-11-18,-13,175,-0.07428571428571429
386,"Guilt I have been feeling really bad guilt thates in waves over the past few months over two decisions I made back in July.

I live in a county with about 60,000 people, and back in July we had about 200 cases and 1 death from the coronavirus. I am 16 and two of my senior friends invited me to their graduation party. I am pretty anti-social and nervous so I was way too scared to decline, especially because they are older (not that this is an excuse). In mymunity, people are not super serious about the virus, so I already knew that people there would not be wearing masks. This may sound stupid, but I was so nervous I was afraid to wear a mask because I would stick out too much (again, not that that is an excuse). I went to two graduation parties, I don't know how many people were there but probably around 30-50 people maybe or more. They were outside, little to no masks. I stayed for around an hour in both I think. I sat at a table in both parties, with five people (3 households) in the first one and 3 people in the second one The tables were pretty large, I was probably only within six feet of the person to my right or left, pretty distant from the one across (I also kind of had my chair back to try and stay distant). In the first party, I only really talked to the host and two other people (same household), probably within six feet (I didn't really know the other people at the table). In the second party I only talked to the same people. I also played a game in both, in the first one with the same people at the table, in the second with three different people. So in summary, I probably came into contact with \~9 different households, and prolonged contact (with talking and sitting/standing next to them for a while) with two.

I feel really guilty about doing this, I know it was really selfish and unsafe to go to these parties. The guilt has been on and off, I feel fine sometimes but then it just hits me and I feel really guilty, and seeing these news articles of super-spreader events has made me feel really bad about what I did. To the best of my knowledge, no one was infected (I trust the hosts would have told me if someone had been), and maybe this should make me feel better, but there is always the chance that my actions led to the infection or death of another. Since then, I have always wore my mask and tried my hardest to be as safe as possible, even turning down a Halloween party invitation, and convincing my family to not gather for Thanksgiving. Lately, I have started donating supplies to a local food shelter to give to people struggling, to try and offset my bad decision.

Thank you so much if you read this whole thing. Now that I have written this out, I don't even know what I wanted from it. Probably just to get it out. I have tried to be as accurate as possible, and not just try to get people to justify my actions. Mostly I just want advice on what I should do to stop feeling horrible, or what to do to redeem myself.

TL;DR: I went to a graduation party and I feel extremely guilty, how can I redeem myself/stop feeling guilty?",7,0.89,jw850j,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jw850j/guilt/,10,Support,2020-11-18,-13,151,-0.08609271523178808

388,"i hate being class of 2020 I’m a senior in high school. I have been a very social person my entire life and usually derive a lot of my happiness from the short term elation of seeing new people and doing new things. Considering this, it feels like i have beenpletely ruined by covid. 

At the beginning of lockdown I confronted my best guy friends and told them I couldn’t maintain my relationship with them unless they cut off their best friend who is a rapist. He’s raped three of my friends. Three. Because they didn’te forward until recently, they just don’t believe them. It’s so fucked up. 

They chose not to cut him off and I lost the people I thought would be my best friends for the rest of high school and some of them beyond. I’m already struggling so fucking much with not being able to see people freely, but on top of that I now know I wouldn’t even have the option to see those people and they don’t give a shit about me. They were my people. I never expected to be so expendable and it makes me feel horrible about myself even though I know I shouldn’t even want them back because they’re condoning a rapist. 

I always imagined my senior year of high school to be one of the best years of my life. I can’t put my disappointments into words. I already didn’t even get to say bye to the entire class of people above me who I loved, and now I won’t get to say goodbye to my own class.

393,"COVID safety family drama Like many of you, I'm taking covid plenty of covid precautions and doing my part. I work from home, use curbside pickup for groceries, avoid people or large groups of people, and don't go out to any bars or restaurants to keep myself and others safe. Though it's been tough, I know we'll go back to normal one day, and my ICU nurse friends are beyond overwhelmed and are begging people to stay home. I feel a responsibility to do my part to help curb the spread. My immediate family on the other hand, is not cautious at all and don't seem to take it seriously. My brother goes out all the time and parties with his friends. My sister has mass gathering birthday parties for her kids, goes on trips, goes out, and her husband loves to party and thinks COVID is just too inconvenient for his lifestyle. 

I've been keeping my distance as I live in another city nearby, but I've always been known as the ""difficult"" one because of my directness and anxiety. My family knows how I feel about covid precautions and my anxiety about it, especially since cases in our area have risen exponentially.

Last week, to avoid being labeled ""difficult"" and to make an appearance, I showed up at my mom's house for a BBQ. My sister, who lives across the street from them, showed up and after I hugged my niece, proceeded to tell me that both of her kids were sick with a runny nose and sore throat. She quickly said it's not covid. I asked if they'd been tested and she said ""no, but kids don't get it. My kids are always sick this time of year.""

Internally, I freaked out. Like a mini anxiety attack. (Even if it weren't a pandemic, I personally would never visit someone if I was sick. To me, especially in a pandemic, it'smon sense to rest and isolate yourself if you have symptoms.) I told my BF to go outside with me so we could chat. We're both on the same page about things but he let me make the decision. I didn't want to offend anyone by telling them why I was leaving, so I just said, ""hey guys, gotta go, I'll see you later"" and I abruptly left to avoid being exposed further. My BF just started a new job and they test him every 2 weeks. He does not have sick time. We won't go out at all if we have any symptoms. We don't want to be exposed, even to a cold as we know it has ripple effects. I was upset at their selfishness of not telling me prior.

The next day, my sister calls me super upset that I ""hurt her feelings"" by leaving right away and I was acting like her kids were walking COVID. (She had just had a self-proclaimed ""small get-together"" for her toddler's 3rd bday, in which I left after 2 hours because a lot of random people were showing up People she didn't even invite. (30+)) Over the phone, she was hysterical about the situation, that I knew I had to just suck it up and apologize if I wanted to have a relationship with her. I understood from her that I came off super rude by leaving and not saying why, and I took responsibility for that and I meant the apology for what I did. I took 100% of the blame to keep the peace. However, she took no responsibility for not telling me her kids were sick. Her wording seemed like she wanted me to be okay with being exposed because ""kids need love and hugs even though they're sick. My mom is fine with it. She loves them."" Girl, I love them kids but we're in the middle of a PANDEMIC. 

My mom's family (brothers, sisters, parents) are having a social distanced thanksgiving lunch in my aunt's big backyard. Everyone will bring their own food and be spaced out pretty well. My 4 aunts have been even more cautious about covid than me. They have not ""hung out"" with anyone. They take it very seriously and put up boundaries early on that my mom seems to respect. They've only done in-car social distanced (not inside the home) visits a handful of times since March. However, my mom gaslights me when I tell her my boundaries, like no hugs or kisses and when I sanitize things. 

I want to know, should I call my aunt that is hosting, kindly decline the invitation, and ask for her perspective on the situation? She knows my mom well, and her sometimes cold, selfish, passive-aggressive, grudge-holding nature. I don't necessarily want to vent, but just want to to suggest that my immediate family does not take it serious and she should ask everyone on the invite list if they have symptoms to please stay home. I will tell her not to mention it because I'm already on the shitlist. I know my mom and sister would still show up for a gathering regardless if they've been around sick people or not. Is it worth it to try to keep my extended family safe (including my 80 year old grandpa with asthma) or should I just keep quiet and hope no one gets sick?

I am not attending this BBQ as I will be with my BF's small family of 4, who I trust because they literally don't go anywhere (his dad had surgery and is stuck at home for 2 months).

I had to move for work and I don’t know anyone, I don’t have anyone. It’s me, and my two dogs. It’s getting hard for me to be productive at work, a job I took because it was a job and one of the few places hiring during Covid. Pretty sure my salary is underpaid by 10-15k. Which doesn’t make things better. I just want this to be over, I want to make friends, I want to go back to a “normal life”, I want to be happy and not think about killing myself every. Day.

I took a big risk this year (late 2019), I quit my corporate career in November, to help my recently retired dad with his business. Found out he was on drugs (meth/cocaine) and kicked me out and made me homeless in late February. After I quit my job, sold my house, and moved cross country for him. I’ve moved 4 times this year, 3 of those have been cross country. I have been scrambling ever since to crawl my way back to normal. Somehow I finished my masters degree in analytics in may, while working nights stocking groceries, somehow I got a job that was a lil better than the last, but doesn’t feel good enough. Somehow I contracted Covid, went through hell and beat it. I went 7-8 months without a job and lost everything due to my father. And now I can’t escape it, nothing to take my attention away of how I ended up here in this chair, in a state I’m unfamiliar with, with no friends, no family to rely on and in a financial hole. My parents are on the brink of a divorce due to my discovery, they start marriage counseling tomorrow. The only good thing is I am younger, 29, but I don’t think anything will be the same again. At least not for me, my life has involuntarily changed forever. Somehow I’m marching ahead. I need a distraction, I go to the gym, but I’ve hit my all time highs in weight, I need something new. I need the daily office buzz and interaction.

It is embarrassing to be in the US knowing this all could be prevented. If we locked down nationwide we would be back at work.

I expected it to be an outdoor pick-up experience. I get there and they tell me the pick-up location is inside the mall, on the second floor. I'm notfortable being indoors unless it's a necessity like a doctor's appointment. To get to the location of pickup, you have to walk through the food court where people are eating without masks.

I asked the guard at the main door of the store if he could find alternative amodations because i'm high risk. His reply.....""high risk for what?""......

We go to a university where testing is free and everyone is encouraged to go 2x per week. My roommate tested positive for COVID--we got the results today, right after we finished eating lunch right across from each other at a 3 ft-wide table. The strange thing is that I went to get tested yesterday only a few hours after her and I got a negative result today. She is leaving later this evening after she finishes packing because we don't have enough space to live separately but I have no idea what to do with our apartment after she leaves. She is my only roommate, and we have our own bedrooms, so I will have the space to myself (with my cat) but I have no idea how to start the process of disinfection, etc.

I've been wiping down cabinet doors, refrigerator handles, the microwave, etc as time allows and we have both been in our own rooms and wear masks when wee out until she leaves. She's also been wiping down everything in the bathroom when she's had to use it, and I've been packing up her stuff inmon spaces. But what is the limit of this/how much do I need to do? She emptied the dishwasher this morning, do I have to try to figure out which dishes she touched? Do I wash every dish because she may have breathed on it? Should I be washing the blankets and somehow disinfecting the couch surface since we've both been sitting on it? Not to mention, I have a cat that she loves and interacts with frequently, and now I don't even know if I should be avoiding my own cat. 

I'm glad me and my roommate won't have to deal with the awkward dance of living in the same space while only one of us is positive but I am still feeling super overwhelmed about how to disinfect after she leaves.

398,"I need someone to talk too. Hey,

My name is Justin. I am a 32 yo male. I work in IT support and live in the Chicago suburbs. I have a wonderful wife and 2 awesome kids. I love film, music and The Ohio State Buckeyes. I enjoy cooking and doing dad stuff. I also like video games and gardening. I enjoy a good cigar as well. 

I am a T2 diabetic and obese. I have struggled with severe anxiety, depression and PTSD from my abusive childhood. I am really struggling with this pandemic. My mental health has been destroyed. I'm talking to a therapist once every two weeks over the phone, but that's not enough. I don't have many friends to confide in because I'm a former fundamentalist/evangelical. All of my friends were from church. 

This might be an odd request, but is there anyone willing to connect with me? I'd prefer it to be a male (just out of respect for my wife) , preferably at least my age or older. And no minors. I really need some support. Being high risk, I'm so very scared of dying from Covid-19 and leaving my family behind. I want to grow old with my wife. I want to meet my grandkids one day. I would like to live to see Cyberpunk 2077 be released 😅

As stated, my mental health is slipping. Yesterday I had a terrible panic attack in a grocery store parking lot and my wife had toe and get me. 

I know this is a long shot, but I could really use a friend. It's difficult making friends in your 30's and this pandemic  has made it harder. If you're a dude who can speak English and you think we could be friends, please send me a message.

400,"A bit worried about using shared airconditioned office vehicle. Please advise/help. So I am from Bangladesh (Southeast Asia) and our office is providing us with free transport from/to home and office. It is a nice gesture/support. But winter is just beginning here and Coronavirus cases have already started to spike. I have to go to office, occasionally. Not everyday. 

My options are to take a motorcycle-sharing ride, which I find safer than sitting inside an airconditioned vehicle (8-9 seaters) with 4-5 other people. They will be wearing mask, but often people just wear flimsy ones which leak air and droplets probably.

The closed space, air-conditioning making the virus spread inside, long period ofmute (1 hour or around  that) are risky points, to me. 

So do I go for the more costly bike/other options?

Or am I worrying over nothing? People at office are still going with fever/cough saying It's just a cold etc.

I will wear two kn95s or one surgical one kn95 tightly  but still. I am afraid of the aerosalized/thinned virus particles.

Already there is no toilet paper or paper towels...kleenex is low...and for some odd reason, wet cat food cans are always VERY low or totally gone! Are people also hoarding for their critters? I guess they must be...aw man.

416,"Depressed and anxious about Covid. Frustrated and angry at stupid, selfish people. I'll be straight up: I live in Wisconsin; if anyone has been keeping informed, you may know that Wisconsin has be a high-risk state. I live in a pretty high-risk area. 

I (24F) still live with my parents who are both in their 50s; my dad is diabetic and my mom has heart and weight issues. I have mild asthma. 

Since June, I've been on Citalopram for anxiety and have been doing CBT because I've been seriously struggling to mentally cope with the Covid situation. The citalopram has helped me not want to curl up into the fetal position, cling to a pillow, and sob uncontrollably from the fear of bing infected or infecting my parents (or worse, having one of them die from it). Still, I constantly think about it even while working and it still causes me a lot of stress. I'm losing hair and eyelashes, and have muscle aches in my neck and face from clenching my jaw all the time. 

My anxiety has turned more into depression lately because I feel like I have nothing to look forward to except getting sick, and watching my parents get sick. It could be really bad for them, and I feel like at any time the nightmare will begin. With Covid being so bad in my area right now, it feels like a pack of wolves are closing in on me and there's nothing I can do to stop it, no matter how many precautions I take. There's just too many stupid people who refuse to avoid crowds, social distance, or wear a mask, and they're the ones making this worse for everybody. I can only do so much before I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time, and by then its too late. 

My workplace is basically on the verge of bing a total sh*tshow. I work in a factory with a lot of other people. We are required to wear masks and take our temperature when we arrive. If we have a fever, cough, shortness of breath, or lose our taste/smell, we are required to report to the nurse and go home. However, in many places in my department, workers are within 6 feet if each other. Nothing ever gets sanitized unless someone gets sick, and then only their workspace gets cleaned (and this is AFTER they actually test positive, days after they call in sick). My shift, for some reason, isn't sending people who were close to a coworker who tested positive home to quarantine. Second shift will-- they've sent the entire department home when one person tests positive, but my shift keeps as many people on as possible, even if they spend 60 hours a week across the line from an infected person. I'm a utility worker and I work with a lot of different people every day. I never know who could be infected. 

Today I came home from work and found out my brother was sick, throwing up and super tired and stuff. Just great. We both work at the same factory; thankfully he works a different shift than me and I almost never see him except on weekends a little since he spends most of his time alone in his room. However, we did talk a bit this past weekend before he showed any symptoms. We didn't get close, as far as I know, except for maybe only a few moments once or twice. He called in and was told to stay home and get tested. Then I got a call from the nurse saying that I needed to quarantine until his test results came back. 

So if my brother has Covid and infected me, I could have potentially infected multiple people at work because I am unable to social distance. If I could, I would, but many times it's impossible. I've thought of quitting multiple times, but I don't have a car right now and its the only job within walking distance that pays.

423,"This life is not a life I turned 28 right before COVID started. My birthday party was the last time I saw most of my friends. Before this I had an amazing social life; I never stayed home on a weekend night. I was out till sunrise with crowds of people all the time. There was always a party or a new bar or a concert to look forward to. Everything felt so bright. I remember sitting on a fire escape smoking and drinking champagne last New Years thinking about how I couldn’t imagine any life better than mine. I was so happy. I was dressed up and looked hot and felt good and cool and young and relaxed and fun and tipsy and hopeful. It feels like a lifetime ago.

I live in NYC and all of my friends but one have moved away during the pandemic, either buying houses in the suburbs or moving out of state permanently or temporarily renting a house in the mountains for a year. I live alone and I can’t get out of my lease but I can’t afford to leave while paying for my apartment. Most of my family lives far away and doesn’t have room for me to stay with them. My job has gone remote since March and it’s likely we will stay remote permanently. I was seeing someone casually at the beginning of this but it has kinda faded out. 

None of my friends or relatives live alone so nobody understands how awful it has been. They justplain about how it’s hard to share a small space with someone else and they’re fighting etc but all I can think about is how I can go for weeks or even months without seeing another human being. I have be a shell of a person. My dog is not enough. My zoom therapy is not enough. I just want to talk to another person face to face without a mask on. I just want to hug someone. I just want to go on a good first date and walk home full of hope and excitement. I just want to look forward to Friday afternoon again because it means I’ll be able to see friends in a few hours. Now I dread Friday because every weekend is two days and three nights of solitary confinement. I can’t read or watch tv or draw or listen to podcasts anymore because I’ve done so much of those things over the past few months. None of it is fun for that long if you have to do it all alone. 

I know this will end some day but I am so miserable I can’t imagine it will really get better. I’ve never had depression before but I don’t think this is the kind of thing that can just be cured by more serotonin...it’s entirely caused by my social situation so nothing will help until that can change. I used to love New York City but now I hate it. I never want to see these streets again. I never want to be around this many unfriendly strangers again. I never want to be so lonely I wish I were dead while still being able to hear my upstairs neighbor and his girlfriend laughing together over dinner. It’s impossible to meet new people in this city without going through someone you already know, so when your whole social circle leaves you are thrust intoplete isolation. Tinder is my only option but it depresses me too much and I’m still a little scared of catching COVID from a stranger.

I have family somewhat nearby who I can visit for the holidays but I’m afraid people will judge me for being irresponsible and traveling to see them. I just don’t think I have it in me to spend thanksgiving and Christmas and Hanukkah alone in my tiny apartment with my dog.

Someone please tell me I’m not alone in feeling this way. Please tell me some day I’ll be able to have a vibrant exciting life again. Please tell me I’ll date again. Please tell me I’ll be surrounded by friends again. Please tell me there’s a reason to keep waking up every morning because right now I don’t see it.",151,0.89,juu4np,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/juu4np/this_life_is_not_a_life/,57,Support,2020-11-16,0,196,0

Additionally, ever since Pfizer's vaccine announcement (by the way, Pfizer expects to submit their vaccine for approval this week, so there's some hopium), the news has often given me hope.

But then again, media gonna media and I'm persistently bombarded by nerve-wracking headlines. Today, the only headline that appeared when you look up 'Anthony Fauci' was from The Hill, Deadline, and the New York Post which claimed that Fauci thinks we need to continue wearing masks and social distancing even after the vaccine.

All 3 articles cited an interview Jake Tapper of CNN with Fauci. I searched through every corner of YouTube, the CNN website, and Twitter. When I could finally find the clip, Fauci simply suggested that more vulnerable people might want to socially distance after getting the vaccine until it's shown to be incredibly effective on people with their condition.

He wasn't saying hugs were a thing of the past, or that vacations were a dead luxury. He simply said vulnerable people *might* want to be cautious even after getting a vaccine. Yet I'm still nervous because of what The Hill said.

Every day, still, my phone slams headlines about ""Return to Normal Still Not Guaranteed,"" ""200,000 Deaths in Between Now and March 2021,"" ""Refrigeration Needs Could Cripple Vaccine."" I just feel battered.

It's so obnoxious and borderline petrifying. I've literally seen the headline ""Have Hope? Here's Some Reality You Idiotic Bimbo"" in so many words. Every second I feel even a sliver of hope, I have a thousand scary headlines thrown at me.

To be more specific for a hike, this could be Iron Mountain in San Diego. On the hike, there's designated paths to walk on so essentially, everybody is following the same route. People pass each other within 2 feet on some areas. If it's on a narrow portion and there's a group of people who don't know hiking etiquette, I may end up being behind them for a minute or two before being able to pass and walk ahead of them.

Of course, the chances of somebody with Covid and deciding to go on a hike are low. Chances of somebody + going to a park are higher than a hike.

I had a moment when I was at the park, somebody sneezed while I was going in the same direction they were. People sneeze for all sorts of reasons and I was able to linger back for a while before continuing, but I don't want to put myself in that scenario again without understanding what science research is out there on particles and transmission outside.

437,"Jumbled Thoughts and Rants about my Paused Life I don't know if this subreddit allows rant posts like this but I just want to vent.

I'm 17, a senior in high school and I'm so sick of being stuck inside. I feel like I've lost all inspiration and passion. I don't do anything anymore. I don't even enjoy playing video games, watching movies or videos anymore. Every time I start a new activity I'll quit five minutes into it to just browse social media again for hours. I feel like I'm drifting away and growing apart from the few friends I have. I just feel like I don't really belong with them anymore as I've been with them so long and I feel like I've changed. I feel as though I'm always trying to blend in with them because I don't even share many of the same interests and hobbies as them. I feel like I made friends with the nerdy/geeky crowd but I'm growing out of those types of people. The very few social interactions I do have with my friends feel like they are getting more and more awkward because of my loss of interest in anything. I'm so fucking lonely. I want to make new real life friends but there is just no natural-feeling way to do it without in-person school. I don't really like talking to people online because if I worry that if I find some people I do enjoy being around, they could live far away and I'd never get to see them physically often. I just want to meet people and discover things. But at the same time, I have no drive or passion to learn or discover new skills and interests. I probably will be stuck like this all the way up until I get to go to Uni in September of next year. But that's so far away and I'm getting such high expectations for when I go there that I won't be so depressed anymore that I'm worried I'll be sad if it doesn't live up to my expectation. I can't fucking take not being able to talk to new people for almost another year. Online school is also so exhausting without any motivation toplete any of my assignments because I can't find any way to be remotely interested in anything I'm learning about. I hate living with my parents now because I feel like I have no privacy with them barging into my room all the time. They're not even being mean or anything, I just feel that I want to start being more independent. Like I wish I was just living by myself so I could just take walks to the store or at a park without feeling like I'm going to be judged by my parents. It's not even that they would judge me negatively for wanting to do activities like that, it's just them noticing and talking about it at all annoys me. I wish I could just fucking hibernate for months on end so I could just start living again. I want to have the drive to do fucking anything. Staying inside just doesn't give me that inspiration. I feel like I'm just waiting for something to keep me going. I just want to feel excited again. I just want to have the passion or interest to create something.

To add fuel to the fire, our kids are in school and the eldest's year group has been asked to stay home as one child in that year has had a confirmed case of covid. She didn't want to send the youngest child in, but he did want to go in and the school has said that siblings don't need to isolate. He has since gone in to school, and my wife is clearly in a panicked state, has told me that she's pletely terrified"".

I want to help her feel better about this. I know that the risk of him catching covid are still rather low, and all of us are other wise healthy so it's highly likely we'd only have a mild case if he did bring it home; however, quoting statistics at someone with severe anxiety doesn't help (in my recent experience). She'll just say something like ""what about long covid?"" or ""I know the stats"" and it bes an argument.

441,"My Fiancé's Roommates' New Mindset of Covid Might Force Him to Move Back Home Hi all!

My fiance and I both live in Orange County and he lives with 2  of his best friend roommates who sisters. The older sister works as a Flight Attendant and about a month ago she contracted COVID and as of a week or so ago, she was given the clear to go back to work by her doctor (so she did). Before she had to quarantine though, her, her sister (who also lives in that house) and their Mom decided to go on a flight to Florida at a theme park, which was concerning my fiance and me. Now, it was more likely that she got COVID from a flight during a work shift prior to the trip, but we found out she was experiencing symptoms as they left for their trip to Florida but didn't tell anyone. Upon their return, my fiance already had minimal contact with both of them, but when he found out she tested positive, he had to scramble out of the house, book a hotel and schedule a test, which became not only inconvenient but also very stressful for him, myself and especially his family. He booked a second hotel close to his family's home in a city about 60 miles from OC, waiting for his results because if he tested negative he would stay with them for the remainder of his roommate's quarantine. Thankfully he was negative and he stayed with his parents for 3 weeks.

Upon returning to OC to the house with his roommates, he tried talking to them and encouraged (especially the one who is a flight attendant) taking extra safety precautions whening back from a flight mon sense right???) and while she agreed, it was only under the mindset of ""totally, if doing that will make you morefortable,""...which boggled my mind because wouldn't someone with that profession be more aware to practice all the safety measures when returning to roommates?? So she went to work on another flight and let them know someone had thrown up on the plane and it wasn't confirmable whether or not it was due to COVID, motion sickness, or some other illness but she didn't seem too bothered by it and brushed kind of brushed off the situation. In general, her view of COVID seems even less of a concern now because she recovered, and before, her sister was also very concerned and asked if she could quarantine aftering back from work, to which she replied, ""I'll only quarantine again if I have it. "" Now BOTH sisters seem indifferent and while it has forced him to stay with his parents again for a week, it's also making him consider moving back home, which I feel is very unfair for him that he has to reschedule his life around his roommates who are being inconsiderate and don’t think it’s a big a deal to being safer. I don't think they understand that even if they don't get it (again), the main concern is spreading it to their family, to me,  and his family, especially both of our moms being immunopromised from cancer.

He (and I) are upset and frustrated and he's especially overwhelmed...How can he approach this major concern with them?? I feel so bad for him that he has to stay with his parents a second time (this whole week) and possibly move outpletely just because his roommate doesn't want to practice something I thought wasmon sense.  And I thought the protocol after flying was to quarantine yourself for at least 2 weeks so you don't accidentally spread to others, not only just when you have it??

444,"Needing Perspectives on Holiday Travel Plans Hi all,

I’m a graduate student who currently lives about 500 miles from my hometown. My mother, who lives alone, would like me toe home for Thanksgiving, and I would, too. We both live alone, and since the fall semester ends at Thanksgiving for me, I could stay home for up to two months, and not have to go without any human contact whatsoever any longer.  Since we’d both be spending the holidays alone otherwise, I’d like to be home without endangering her health. 

I have been rigorously social distancing since March. I only leave my apartment once a week to take out my trash and check whatever mail I have, and that’s it. Everything else (groceries, takeout, etc.) hase via contactless delivery. I have basically not even seen another human being in person in months. My mother is…decidedly less intense about it, but has been at home for the last few weeks since cases started to spike in my home state. She is 65+ and obese (but not morbidly), with prediabetes and medically-controlled hypertension. I am 28 and obese (also not morbidly), with no other conditions that I know of.

To make the trip, I would be driving 500 miles, and would need to refuel exactly twice. I have a reusable N99 mask and a face shield to wear while refueling, as well as gloves and sanitizer to handle the pump itself. Upon arriving, I plan to quarantine in the bonus room of my family home for fourteen days, and use our basement bathroom. This would mean that although we couldn’t celebrate Thanksgiving in the same room, we can hopefully be together safely for the usual pre-Christmas holiday traditions (decorating, watching films, etc.).

I have no idea where all of this falls in the spectrum of advisable activities. I have no idea if I’m being too extreme on other side – jeopardizing my mother’s life by driving home, or taking unnecessary precautions by quarantining after what should be (in theory) a low-contact travel experience. But since cases are seemingly spiking everywhere and everywhere I go, I’m seeing warnings not to travel, I could use whatever perspectives you all might have to steer me in the right direction.

Hope everyone is staying sane and well (or as well as can be expected) in these unusual and fairly terrifying times!",2,0.67,juv47j,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/juv47j/needing_perspectives_on_holiday_travel_plans/,10,Support,2020-11-16,-5,140,-0.03571428571428571

So my husband tested positive for COVID on Friday, but he was exposed for a week before then. So COVID was floating around our basement apartment for a week already. I have not gotten a positive yet, but the doctor said I should just assume I have it.

My question is, do we still need to isolate from each other? Can we sleep in the same bed, or stay in the same room? How do we isolate from each other if we live in a small basement apartment? Can we pass the virus back and forth more if we do not isolate?

We attended an outdoor, masked party on Sunday (removed masks to eat and drink, however). My sister held my 9-week-old baby for a short period of time.

462,"Household Planned Thanksgiving Gathering and Purposefully didn't Tell Me I'm a college student living with grandparents. Both to save money and to help them with the property. My Grandma is usually pretty good about following the guidelines, as I am as well. We go food shopping and I go to school and home. That's all. 

Before Covid we always held Thanksgiving and Christmas here at grandma's because it was big enough for the whole family. Nothing was said about this year so I figured it was postponed. Welle to find out my aunt and her kids from out of state planned the whole thing with my mom and other aunt, and pressured my grandma in to holding Thanksgiving anyway. So I found out by finding out my Aunt is flying here next week...to stay for a whole week ...and my mom told my Grandma not to tell me because I'd ""have a fit.""

I am definitely having a fit. This is extremely irresponsible. Not that I'd expect any less from my extended family. But this caused me to fight with my grandma and now most of the family is guilt tripping and gaslighting me. I live here too and I'm an adult. Doing all this behind my back is horrible. I'm stuck with either 2 options. Hiding in the basement for a week because that's ""my"" part of the house and risk theming down here to harass me, or go stay with a friend. Which they bullied me about saying I'll go stay at another house with other people but won't stay with them. 2 people hanging out with masks is a hell of a lot less risky than a hoard of people from different states without masks.

463,"Should I have my kid tested? We have been extremely careful, we have everything delivered and bleach all goods going into the house. I'm the designated hunter/gatherer of the family and last went out a week ago, my exposure risk then was pretty low (open air excursion, masked). No one else goes out. 
My kid (5 yo) ran a fever the other day, low grade, runny nose, scratchy throat. Fever gone in 24 hours, runny nose slightly improved. I isolated her from the other kids but am now disturbed because her brother now has a runny nose too, which means whatever she has is contagious and not just allergies + one of those unexplained fevers kids get.
I don't feel a thing and neither does my husband. If it is COVID, it must mean one or both adults are asymptomatic (my kids do not go out), but if my kid is patient zero, how the heck could she have gotten it?

465,"I was exposed to COVID and I'm so scared. Please help me. This is going to be a long one guys, I'm sorry. Please help me.

I work with kindergartners. Basically, while all the schools are closed down with parents still going out to work, the kids need to be supervised, and that's my job. I make sure each kid is attending their online classes, behaves, and entertain them until they get picked up. 

Today, I received a notice that a preschool separate from my location had multiple confirmed cases of COVID, and the siblings of these kids who attend my location are all quarantined. 

Cool, I guess. Close one, but at least there's a decentish chance I haven't been exposed. 

Then later in the day, one of my kids in my class (who was quarantined) was confirmed for COVID. I assume the last day of exposure was yesterday, 11/12/2020, but the notice I received says 11/10/2020. I don't know which kid it was, as my anxiety wracked mind cannot think straight to figure it out. 

I'm so scared. I have to get tested. My mom says that for the time being, I'll be all alone in the bedroom. I cannot leave the bedroom unless there's an emergency or I have been confirmed to be negative (I plan on getting tested twice if my first test is negative in case of a false negative). 

My kinders have no idea what's going on. We didn't tell them. They were all wondering why all the kids were leaving so early (my boss emailed every parent as soon as she got the news). They think we'reing back on Monday, but no. Our classroom is closed until the 24th at the very least. 

This isn't like the cold or anything I've ever been ailed with. This is the frickin coronavirus. I'm facing natural selection now. I'm 19, female, perfectly healthy with no underlying conditions. I can still die though. My mom and younger sister might have it too because I was the point of exposure. 

When this pandemic began, I feared that I was going to be the one to take it home, that I was going to be the reason why we're all going to suffer, that I was going to be the reason I put everyone at risk, that I was going to be the reason that someone could possibly die. 

I don't want to lose my mom or sister. I don't want to die and leave them and my amazing, amazing, absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to me boyfriend. He's worried about me. He tried to tell me to quit my job because I could always catch COVID twice, but I refuse. 

I love my job. This is my very first job and my boss is so kind and understanding. My job aodates my college schedule and I get paid fairly well for it. I love my kinders with a burning passion and it hurts me to know that they probably have COVID too. 

Silver lining, I guess this means I get paid time off and a good excuse to stay in bed all day.

I think it's a safe assumption that they both have COVID 19. What should they do, aside from the obvious stuff like take C, D, and zinc, get rest, don't go out, etc?

468,"A new lockdown ising, I just broke up and I don't know how to cope I'm 22 and I live in Italy. Here the situation is getting worse. From this Sunday my region will have more restrictions, it will be an ""orange zone"" which means for example that the majority of the activities are closed and I basically can't go outside of my city (there's also curfew from 10pm).

And I actually don't know how to cope. Just a few weeks ago I broke up with my boyfriend because he was psychologically abusive, he hit on another woman and lied to me hundreds of times during the course of 2 years, but also kept lying almost in a pathological way when I confronted him, even regarding obvious things. So I had to break up.

But now with all the new restrictions and the feeling that my region will be a red zone, which means total lockdown, I feel very alone and almost in a depressive state. In fact I already spend 95% of the time at home and because of the break up, anxiety etc. I seem I can't find anything to do that I really like. I feel like everything bores me after a while (like watching tv series, movies, playing games, etc.) except for working out sometimes, but lately I feel so bad that I don't even have the energies to work out. I just spend my days on myputer, on Youtube, then here on Reddit, Instagram and so on. On the same 4-5 sites over and over again.

And in the past few days the need of going out, meeting new people but especially having someone with whom I can get close to, is getting extremely intense. I feel like I'm craving affection, and closure but I can't do anything about it. I have a couple of friends with whom I am in contact with but because of the situation I won't be able to see them.

I tried to get in contact with some guys I used to go out with sometimes, also some of them texted me a few times, but because they already have a gf and other reasons, they just aren't interested in getting close to me and the conversations are really short.

I attend online lessons but it's so hard to keep concentration and I just can't study.

470,"OCD sufferer about to test positive for COVID-19 Hi guys! I'm in need of support right now. I feel incredibly stressed and overwhelmed. I have a very debilitating case of contamination OCD, so as you can imagine this pandemic has been a nightmare for me. That said, I have thus far managed to avoiding into contact with COVID. 

That all changed today. My brother (whom I live with) has unexpectedly tested positive for COVID. When we found out he was positive, I started scrutinising my own health and realised I literally can't taste or smell a single thing. 

My parents and I all went for tests earlier and I'm 99% certain I'm going to test positive, so I've been self-isolating from the rest of my family since we went for the test (along with my brother who is also isolating in a different room). 

Being alone with not much to do has given me a LOT of time to think which is OCD's worst enemy. I'm now convinced my physical condition is getting worse and I'm going to wake up tomorrow feeling like shit. I'm terrified of enduring the next two weeks without being able to get a hug off my mum.

474,"Transmission risk at home – or am I overly paranoid? Hello, seeking some scientifically minded counseling or reassurance here. I'll preface by saying that I have anxiety and have always been a bit of a germophobe. I currently live with my parents in a small house. I haven't gone anywhere in months, I'm very scrupulous about washing hands and cleaning just about everything Ie in contact with, but the rest of the household seems rather lax. They wear masks when out and about, but that's about it. I've noticed minor cleaning of grocery packages (if any), casually taking deliveries unmasked, visiting relatives, uncovered sneezing and coughing, and most concerningly, they babysit a toddler whose parents are essential workers. The tipping point was when the boss of one of the toddler's parents tested positive, but said parent was forced to work and didn't get tested (They wear a mask though). 

  
 While I spend most of my time cooped up in my room, I worry about the rampant, allergy-fueled sneezing and coughing that goes on throughout the day, especially in the bathroom, which I unfortunately share. Normally I observe the times estimated for dispersal of aerosols, like say at least 3 hours for sneezes\*, but the doubts linger and nag. And now that the air conditioning season is over, the concern only got worse because of decreased air circulation (We still keep some windows open, but not exactly wide). It's reaching the point where I skip meals because someone had a coughing fit in or near the kitchen, not to mention all the - often loud- talking going on. I also get more than a little nervous about unwanted close conversations (Less than a minute at a time, seldom more than once a day), not only because of the inhaling, but also because I fear viral particles clinging to me. Indeed, I often Lysol my clothes after I get ambushed for close talk, or when I have no choice but to walk through an area where someone just had some form of exhalation. I can't even touch my hair after someone breathes near me lest I spread the stuff all over my workspace. A simple drive-by “good morning” at close range is enough to ruin my day. When talking needs to be done, I try to stay far away, and I'm aware that the 6 foot rule is not usually enough. The occasional room intrusion doesn't help either, and people have coughed nearby when my door is open (I usually stay about 10 feet away from it). I often find myself doing Sherlock Holmes style mental calculations about air currents to watch my moves but I still fear breathing in someone's potentially infected gusts.   

Not knowing what the contagious dose is, or how much it takes for a virus to rub onto a surface, so much as a split-second tap on a doorknob with my hand as I walk past it sends me back to washing (The skin on my hands is really showing it despite moisturizing). Something as simple as making a sandwich involves about 3 or 4 hand washes from touching kitchen surfaces and food packaging. Discussing things won't help, as I'm generally regarded as the weirdo of the family, so I'm basically on my own here. My disinfecting habits are generally derided, and wearing a mask around the house will probably get me a long, stern talk. “It only happens to malnourished people who don't take care of themselves” or “The neighbors caught it and they're ok now” are the usual stonewalls. 

  
  In short, I'm locked down in my room due to lingering exhalations, often to my detriment. I get extremely uneasy not only about breathing stuff in, but also about viral particles clinging to me, and I worry about catching it from merely touching my shirt after a talk, and absent-mindedly scratching my nose or rubbing an eye later.   No one in the house has tested positive or shown symptoms, but I take no chances as I live in a hot spot and several people I know have caught it, so I'm pretty much acting like the people around me are infected. Question is – am I exaggerating things? Sometimes I feel like the Lysol fumes will get me before the virus. 

  
  \*I saw a study that said 16 hours but avoiding bodily needs for that long is impossible so I guess I'm about minimizing rather than eliminating potential exposure.

476,"Lost My Job... AGAIN This year has been hell for me. I’m 18 in the Class of 2020 so self explanatory. I started working at the movies last summer and everything was going good until the pandemic started. My job shut down, but I was getting unemployment so I was still making some type of ie. After the $600 extension ended , I was only making $86 a week. Not a lot but still thankful for the ie.

Late September, my job called and said they were reopening. I was back at work after months which helped my mental health immensely since I had the opportunity to socialize with customers and my coworkers. It was way better than spending every single day inside the house doing online college (it’s horrible, i don’t rmend it AT ALL) and having mental breakdowns everyday because this year has screwed me over multiple times. Plus I was making about $500 every other week, which is money I was saving up for my second semester of college that starts two months from now.

But yesterday, I got a call from my boss saying we’ve shut down again until things get better whenever that is. So I’m back on unemployment making $200 every other week. But this time around since I’m not making a good enough ie on unemployment to cover all my college finances, I’ll probably have to drop out of college. Really sucks because I was the first to graduate high school in my family (hence why graduation was a BIG deal to me) and the first to go to college, let alone my DREAM college. My parents have to take care of my other siblings and though they have maintained their jobs, I’m not sure if they can shell out thousands of dollars during this time when every dollar is more valuable than ever. Community college also isn’t an option for me and if i drop out of my dream college, chances are close to none that I’ll get back in if I decide to go back when things settle down. My college also has one of the best programs in the country for my major (nursing) so dropping out of an institution that was really going to help pave a good career for me makes me so upset.

It just sucks. I worked so hard to get to this point. Being the first in my family to aplish these important milestones. Years of straight A’s and high achievements just to be a college dropout.

I've not done anything for the last few weeks besides go to work and even then I have this really bad feeling that if the positivity rate exceeds 50 percent we're going to have to close again at Goodwill. :(

We are not like the other stores or businesses that only issue half ass measures in regard to masks and social distancing.

As I mentioned previously before, we are now banning people for life if they make a huge scene about our mask policies. We're not jerks to people who don't wear a mask properly but we give them only one warning and we can provide them with masks if they need them.

I feel like our Goodwill outlet store is an oasis of sanitypared to what is happening in Wisconsin but I'm still having a hard time shaking the feeling that our luck could run out soon.

At this rate Wisconsin may not even need a vaccine considering that half of the state's population probably has had the virus so far if we keep this rate up. (I'm not advocating for herd immunity just ament).

Especially during the pandemic, I've sometimes gaslit myself into thinking I'm being overly paranoid while people around me are more lax. This is what I did to myself while we were waiting to get coffee. So I just stood there absolutely anxious as f\*ck while my lab mates and advisor talked. All in all, we were only in the coffee shop for probably like 10 minutes, grab and go. I had a mask that seals around my nose on the entire time, and I had no sustained contact with any of the unmasked people (it was honestly alarming how many people weren't wearing masks and just acting like things were normal). But still, one of those people HAD to have had COVID (there is just so much of it here in Montana). This morning I woke up and spiraled into severe self-hatred over this. Why didn't I just listen to my difort and wait outside? Why do I always do this to myself? After all I've done, is this going to be the thing that gets me sick? Is this going to be the one bad move? I'm just so mad at myself and I feel so out of control. And on top of everything I'm so lonely and have no friends around here, so I spend most of my time just spiraling in and out of self-hatred over a variety of COVID and non-COVID related things.

I ended up catching something (wasn’t covid, tested negative for covid more than once) and so obviously I was being too liberal with my social interactions. I feel like every choice I make is between slowly killing myself or causing someone else’s death. And now that everything is so politicized people either say “you’re a terrible person for going out I hope you catch it” or “oh whatever not many people die from it masks aren’t useful etc”.

They were looking for volunteers to give up their seats for flight vouchers. That should have been my first red flag. The entire flight was full. Every. Single. Seat.

Then I got in my seat (middle seat) and the man next to me (in the aisle seat) sits  down. He's wearing a neck guard, and looks very sweaty. I get it, maybe he ran to his gate. Whatever. We take off.

The  man starts coughing and continues to sweat. Like wheezing coughing. A  couple times he is just kind of wheezing without making sound. Worst   part is that his neck guard will not cover his nose, he has the top of the band over his lips. I asked him to pull it up and cover his nose but he wouldn't keep it up. He keeps his nose out the entire flight.  Flight attendants came around constantly but say NOTHING to this man, nose in  the air.

496,"New GF during Covid, need advice TLDR - I'm in a new relationship with someone whose covid network & roommate situation feels more unwieldy than mine. Tips to navigate?

Hope you all can provide some advice for a situation I'm having trouble figuring out how to navigate. Some details changed/simplified for readability and anonymity:

I (32M) live alone, work remotely, and have been pretty cautious during Covid -- I'd say like 8/10. I take essential trips (grocery store, pharmacy) only and will see friends outside and at a distance. I don't wipe stuff down or wear gloves or anything like that, but think that I'm taking the virus very seriously, albeit with a few calculated risks. I live in a major urban area in the US where cases are on the rise.

I met Jess (32F) on tinder in June, hit it off, and had a ""date"" via FaceTime, which lasted 2 hours. We agreed to do a socially-distant outdoor walk, and after 2 more walks, made the relationship official.

Here's the issue: Jess lives with 2 roommates, each of whom has a significant other who does not live in their house but is wee in their house during Covid. Their parents also drop by occasionally. Jess also has 2 siblings who live together and parents who live in the area, and she sees them both, outside when possible but also in their homes. She swears that all of these people are very careful about Covid and don't go anywhere, but it seems like a lot of people's behavior to keep track of. Jess has also been working throughout Covid, but works entirely outside and is good about mask-wearing, etc.

I will admit -- I've let my guard down since seeing Jess. Shees over to my apartment and I to her house, and our relationship is fully physical. I have also been to her parents' house (inside) a few times and seen her friends in small outdoor groups. I've essentially partmentalized"" for the sake of our relationship but things feel different now that cases are on the rise so dramatically. I want to rein it in. Worth noting: I have not changed my behavior with my friends, family, etc. - only as it relates to interactions with Jess and her circle.

Is there a way we can safely navigate this? It seems unfair of me to ask her/her roommates to adjust their behavior..... I can always have her at my place, but that essentially means I'm exposed to everyone she's exposed to. It feels too early in our relationship for her to move in with me and there are some logistical constraints there too. 

Is there apromise or solution I'm missing here? I realize that I'll probably need to accept some level of risk if I want to be physically close with her, but having trouble figuring out where/how to draw that line. One proposal is that she wears a mask while in her house when her roommates are home.",10,0.92,jt0lkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jt0lkx/new_gf_during_covid_need_advice/,7,Support,2020-11-13,-1,164,-0.006097560975609756
497,"Will I Be Able to Fulfill My Plans for Next Summer? Last month, me and my father began drafting plans to visit Bosnia. (I'm currently 14, just so you have a better understanding of my situation.) I've wanted to visit Bosnia for a little while now, both because it's an [absolutely beautiful country]( and it's importance in understanding the psychology of the average human.

If you don't know, in 1914, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian high schooler of Serbian descent and culture, shot and killed the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand. This caused an uproar in the Austro-Hungarian government, who suspected Serbia was behind the assassination, as Princip was of Serbian descent and had ties to numerous Serbian nationalist groups. Because of this, they declared war on Serbia the following month on July 28, 1914. Russia then mobilized its military in support of Serbia, followed by Germany in support of Austria-Hungary, then France in support of Serbia and Russia, so on and so forth until much of Europe, the Middle East, and North America were at war - World War 1.

After the war, people lost faith in science and philosophy as institutions that could make the world a better place. From around the formation of Judaism to the Renaissance, people viewed the Earth as a boring, dull, drudgerous trial preparing Christians, Jews, Muslims, etc. for the afterlife. However, during the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Scientific Revolution, people began hoping to create a better Earth, as opposed to just relying on Heaven. However, after World War 1, people saw the destruction wrought by dreadnaughts and chlorine gas (two things made possible by engineering, a scientific field), and lost faith in science.

This is why people are bing more pessimistic as time goes on. No one has faith in science, philosophy, or the afterlife due to the Enlightenment and first world war, so we have basically given up on creating a better world. This is called postmodernity, and because the rise in postmodern feelings was caused by the first world war, which was caused by events in Bosnia, that is why I wish to visit Bosnia.

Regardless, I'm worried I won't be able to. I and my father are scheduling our trip for early July 2021, but I'm honestly really worried we won't be able to by then. I worry that by the time July *does* roll around, enough people wouldn't have gotten the vaccine for us to take the trip without endangering others. I worry that in Bosnia, the pandemic will still be raging on, leaving us unable to visit there.

I feel like crying just typing this. You legit can't grasp how much I want to visit Bosnia. It's fucking insane how much I want to see the Latin Bridge, Fethija Mosque, Christ Our Savior Cathedral, Obljaj, Museum of Sarajevo, Sacred Heart Cathedral, Bascarsija, Green Visions, Popovo Fields, Republica Srpska Museum, Public Turkish Bath, Wall of Ston, Lower Lakes, Old Bazar Kijundziluk, etc. I know it's unlikely, but I'm so worried that we won't be able to.

However, this was the first day we used this type of test, the new person administering them was not confident in what she was doing, there was a lot of confusion and missing paperwork, and I actually ended up having to swab myself (which I'm still not sure I did correctly).


On top of all that, I honestly have no idea how I might have been exposed. The only people I have been in contact with for months are half a dozen coworkers who all wear PPE and have all tested negative. I suppose I could have picked it up at the store but I've only been to the store once in two week and that was at night when there was maybe four other customers in the building. I was also wearing a mask and gloves at the time and I always sanitize like a crazy person every time I leave my home.


So now I'm left wondering: am I actually positive or was the test wrong? Am I just in denial? Has anyone here dealt with this kind of uncertainty even after a positive test? I know it's more likely that I'm asymptomatic or presymptomatic but part of me still refuses to believe that I have COVID at all.

**EDIT**: Got the results from my PCR test back today - it's negative! Also got another rapid test done, just to be safe, and that's negative, too!

So presumably, I did get a false positive on that first test?

503,"UPDATE : Friend tested positive, going to wedding anyways, bride and groom don't care... I reported, dropped out, now they want me topensate them for RSVP costs... Update from : [

I went ahead and reported the wedding to the county health department. They assured me it was an anonymous report, but I'm honestly a bit worried the bride will somehow figure out it was me, or when the health department handles it they'll use some wording that points to me, or something. I don't know, I know I did the right thing, but still a bit worried because the bride is question is a bit scary and if she figured out it was me I honestly think she'd drive up to my house to 'confront me' or threaten me in anger, and I'm not kidding about that. I'm not entirely sure what happens next, but it sounds like the health department will handle it. Still, a bit overly nervous at the moment. All I know is that they'll handle it... Does that mean they'll try to get the wedding cancelled?

In other news, the positive bridesmaid is still going to the wedding. The funny thing is, since I made my last post, another bridesmaid tested positive and she dropped out of the wedding. (I think the bride has, what, maybe 3 bridesmaids left?) However, since the wedding is in 2 days, the bride/groom still have to pay for meal/RSVP/whatever cost for her. The bride demanded the positive bridesmaid pay up an RSVP cost for dropping out, which she did immediately. Reminder, this is the same bride who publicly posted to her wedding Facebook page that if you don't go to her wedding because you're scared of a cold, you're out of her life and you're toxic (with a #Live #Laugh #Love picture, so you can imagine how big of a hit losing her is). I definitely am cutting things off with her ASAP given what a mess this whole thing has been.

Now here's the thing : I told bride on Monday, very kindly and wishing her well, that I wasn'tfortable going to the wedding, which she didn't reply to immediately (although 20 minutes later she posted a public snapchat story about 'If you don'te to my wedding, you're done. Bye, you're out of my life. FK you!!!' (Fourth one now in the past 2 weeks). She got back to me today, just an hour ago, with a simple message (which I'm going to slightly alter, but you get the picture). 'Dinner($x) + RSVP cost($x) + Bridesmaid lineup($x) + Wedding gift($x) + Bridesmaid party chip-in ($x) = $136' (Which is the exact value she said). The next message was her Venmo info, followed by a :) ... Am i being crappy if I sort of don't want topensate her given her uncaring and downright hostile attitude towards everyone?

504,"Preparing for getting sick to ease stress Got my results back a few hours ago that I have Covid. (42f with 3 young kids and sick husband waiting for his results) I thought it might be helpful if others knew the things I have been using to get through it. Also, maybe others have items that could be added to the list?
1. Heating pad or heated blanket (helps with body aches and chills) My heating pad has helped when the stomach upset started about 2 days ago. 
2. Pain medicine (ibuprofen and Tylenol). These helped with the fever, and body aches but only dulled the constant headaches unfortunately. I am on day ten and have a very mild headache. Yay!
3. Stomach medicines for the intestinal upset. I used tums and pepto to dull the pain along with heating pad. 
4. Ice pack to put on eyes and head for headaches and eye pain
5. Extra blankets if heated blanket (wish I had) is not available. My chills were unbearable until I layered 3forters and put on thick socks. 
6. Crackers and microwaveable soups and meals. The exhaustion is pretty bad and it is so easy to not eat, especially with stomach upset and loss of smell. But you must try. I didn’t eat and felt faint. I ate and felt horrible stomach upset but I started to feel more strength and also less anxiety. 
7. Water!!! And anything that will make drinking water palatable. I lost my sense of smell a week ago and my taste is dulled. I normally drink water but with the stomachaches it was hard and I tried to drink a cup of water every hour. I am still dehydrated but getting better.
8. Paper and pen with dates to record all of your symptoms because you will be asked and the brain fog is horrible. 
I’m sorry if these things seem simple but truly the brain fog is bad. I hope you all stay well. I’m so sorry that the anxiety of these times are bad. These things have helped me so far, maybe being prepared with these things will lessen some anxiety, for someone.

507,"Is this travel too risky? Interested in perspectives I live in San Antonio, Texas and my father lives in Colorado Springs. We usually meet up several times a year to go to concerts together and just to hang out, but COVID19 has obviously made concerts an impossibility. He is in his mid-70s and I'm in my early 50s, and we are both strong believers in the importance of masks, social distancing, and not putting other people at risk. My stepmom is in her early 70s and is at higher risk than either of us due to underlying health conditions. Even though I haven't interacted face-to-face with more than two or three human beings in my workplace, I do work at an institution that does regular surveillance testing, including a COVID19 test which I took yesterday morning. (I've had two other tests in the past six weeks, both of which were negative.) 

In mid-September, we decided that we would meet up in Lubbock for a few days. It's a rough midpoint between our two cities, and we stayed in a Residence Inn hotel in two adjoining rooms that had their own kitchens. We brought some of our own food, ordered additional meals through DoorDash, and -- with the exception of a few outdoor walks in unpopulated areas -- wepletely avoided interaction with other people. We declined room service and did not visit any stores. It all worked out just fine, but Texas was in much better shape in mid-September than it is today (November 12, 2020). 

We have been planning to meet up again this weekend. Lubbock is out of the question because of a huge football game at Texas Tech, so we've decided to do the same thing a bit further up the road in Amarillo. However, Amarillo and Lubbock are in very bad shape right now as far as infections, hospitalizations, and available hospital beds are concerned. 

I'm trying to figure out if it is reckless to make this trip. My three primary concerns are:

* *Heightened theoretical risk when staying in the hotel due to greatermunity spread.* Although we have both been very diligent about avoiding other people, there is always some theoretical risk and it seems likely that these risks would increase in correlation with increased infections in themunity. 
* *The potential for transmission as a result of hotel air conditioning.* The chain that we use has always seemed to have good hvac systems, but I'm not familiar with the Amarillo location and it seems that the HVAC risks would also increase in tandem with greatermunity spread. 
* *My inevitable need to use the restroom several times along the way* because I drink lots of water and am a man in his early 50s. During my previous trip, I relied on McDonald's restrooms. They're clean if not terribly well ventilated. This time, I might just pull off on some gravel roads and go outdoors where nobody can see me, so this one isn't such a big deal. 

I'm really excited about hanging out with him, but I would feel terrible if something happened to him or my stepmom as a result of us being too reckless. I know that he is also concerned. Also, we have been seeing all of the warnings about avoiding travel during Thanksgiving, and -- though it's a couple weeks before the actual holiday -- this trip would definitely be Thanksgiving-adjacent. 

I would be really interested in knowing what others think about this. Thanks!",2,1,jsym0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jsym0e/is_this_travel_too_risky_interested_in/,5,Support,2020-11-13,-16,196,-0.08163265306122448

It went away after 3 days.

This isolation and confinement makes me irrationally despise my roommate for little to no actual reasons (he is very orderly and clean and quiet, it is just my cabin fever). There are no actual problems between us or our living situation, I think it is just the coronavirus isolation confinement, I know other people in similar situations are also struggling in that way.

But...this hellish year since about March...dear god...it hurts. I just want it all to finally be over. I want to feel ""free"". It is very hard to push away the disturbing and invasive thoughts that oftene with my cruddy mental health stuff.

I find it hard sometimes to let myself cry out the stress now because I have found that I be increasingly numb and withdrawn. Is this my minds way of getting through this weird world crisis? It is difficult to tell...it feels like I sometimes can not think clearly. Small, simple things take a lot more effort for me than they once did. I resent seeing people sometimes going about their days as if everything is perfectly happy and right with the world. It hurts to see.

527,"I have covid symptoms. I'm starting to get better. My cats seem to have got it from me. One is better. One is not. To make a long story short my cats are my world. I lost a child and a fiancee(miscarriage and the toll it took on her dissolved our relationship) after she left me the cat we had together and the cat i found shortly after she left became my world. Salem is the cat we had together. He is the one that seems to have turned a corner and just has some slight sneezing left over from it. Vaxis is the cat I found shortly after she left me. He is...absolutely and totally my baby. 

How I found him goes like this. After my ex left me, I found these two kittens where I live(people drop off kittens a lot here because they know the people where I live will feed them) one tabby and one jet black cat. The tabby was ultra friendly, the black cat was super standoffish. But they were brothers and let me both cuddle them(people have always said I was a cat whisperer) well I brought them in one day while I was feeling particularly down from my ex leaving me, I cuddled them both, loved on them, but knew I couldn't keep them. I put them back outside and would keep an eye on them as they worked their way into the feral colony we have around my house. 

Well one day I came home from work and found the tabby had been hit by a car. It was awful, and I gave him a proper burial, I saw no sign of the black kitten anywhere. I went to get booze or something(I'm a bit of an alcoholic due to depression and what have you). Well I got back home and saw the black kitten sitting exactly where his brother had died. I stopped my car and put it in park and walked up to him. He was skiddish but didn't run away. He just meowed up at me with a little meow which I interpreted as ""why"". I picked him up in my arms and promised him he would never want for anything again. I would spend my last money to give him the temptations treats he loves. I have spent my last 100 dollars i had in the bank to take him to the vet cause his meow was weak once. 

Now where we are now. 

I've been dealing with covid symptoms the past week, I think I'm finally starting to beat it. I'm honestly not a bit worried about myself though. Vaxis(the cat im worried about) has been breathing heavily through his mouth all day today and has mostly avoided me. He has zero interest in his treats right now which really worries me. His adopted older brother had a couple of mildly rough days(lots of sneezing, lethargy) but now seems to be fine. Just a bit ago he came down where he was hiding in the closet and let me cuddle him(and tearfully beg him not to leave me). I have Googled covid in cats and the CDC seems to say there have been no deaths. Tell me I'm just overreacting. Tell me my baby will be fine. I'm a Satanist so I don't believe in prayer but ill take any good vibes just so that my baby won't leave me.

Edit: after posting this initially I got blocked from posting here for a bit. I contacted the mods and was enabled. Currently vaxis is sitting on my lap and seems to be breathing through his nose a bit better and may even be resting(which i haven't seen him be able tofortably do all day) please, whatever good energy is out there let him be okay.

Edit 2: since I've posted this he has totally fallen asleep in my lap. He's not breathing out of his mouth at this point and seems to be breathing deeply enough that his breaths seem to be consistent. I do plan on taking him to the vet if this persists.(I live in a very rural area so overnight vets are basically non existent here) but I'm hoping this is just me overacting and being stupid.",104,0.95,jrj708,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jrj708/i_have_covid_symptoms_im_starting_to_get_better/,19,Support,2020-11-11,-7,214,-0.03271028037383177
528,"Feeling Unsafe & Pressured at Work Hi All,

Long time lurker who noticed some folks have issues @ work that are similar to mine. Basically, I work as an Exec. Assistant for a Construction Managementpany in NYC- except we're on the actual jobsite itself. We're on the 7th floor of this in progress construction project, so on a daily basis I witness both construction **and** office workers go maskless, overcrowd the hoist (no social distancing), and conduct large meetings in the conference room. On top of all this, the CEO has, on two separate occasions, gone to states that require quarantine upon arrival back in NY, which he obviously does not do because I see him back in the office the next day. This morning, I received a forwarded email from said CEO from a coworker who woke up with a fever, sore throat, and body aches. This made me very ufortable as I had direct contact with this coworker yesterday. The only real action our CEO took with this was announcing it later in the day during our staff meeting, suggesting people possibly receive a rapid test. However, my issue with this is that this guy puts so much pressure on everyone to be in the office and needs a legitimate reason for people to work from home. Once I find out that this coworker does indeed have COVID, I plan to make a rapid test appt. and work from home until I can receive one. The only thing holding me back from doing so is knowing how much of a guilt trip CEO guy is going to lay on me once I tell him I'd feel safer working from home until I know I'm not infected. I guess what I'm looking for is an affirmation that I'm not being overly cautious or paranoid by choosing to work from home (I am able to efficiently work from home) until I know I'm not positive.

531,"Online classes have been kicking my a*s. I'm in high school right now and am doing a hybrid of online and in-person lessons during these times. I know it's silly and there are so many people who are dealing with much more pressing issues but I've just been finding it so hard to learn and understand what I am being taught online. The difference and changes are just hard to deal with I guess.

When I first started, I knew things would be different and with ites obstacles I haven't had to deal with before but I didn't imagine it to be so mentally draining. My biggest problemse from having a horrible wifi connection and the general atmosphere that online school provides. Buffering audio + video makes it really difficult to understand and follow along with the teacher and the speed at which material is being taught and tested is really getting to me. Subjects and units that I typically enjoy are now mundane and joyless things to learn which in turn have affected my performance in any tests or projects I've been assigned.

While all these things are silly and not that big of a deal, over time they've just been getting me down and affecting me a lot. I started school in mid-September and it's only just November at the time I post this which shows how easily and quickly this has made me want to tear my hair out. For the most part, I've been doing pretty well with the in-person classes I've had and they're nice to attend but as cases rise where I live, I imagine I'll be attending only online classes and doing work from home. Even though I know this is what a lot of people like me are doing and it's what we have to do to slow the spread of COVID, it just makes me so anxious and worried to think about it and if I'm not able to keep up and pass my classes.

I know that there are so many people in the world that are going through so many harder and horrible things but I still wanted to share my experience to see if someone else is going through anything similar.

539,"Wanting to isolate myself, even virtually. Just feeling overwhelmed by everything and hopeless about the future So I live in British Columbia, Canada, and our COVID cases have been absolutely SPIKING over the past few weeks. It's gotten to a point where our provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, has recently imposed new restrictions outright prohibiting social gatherings inside other people's homes for two weeks, although I have a feeling our ""second lockdown"" will go on for much longer than that. I had been seeing some of my friends over the summer after initial restrictions were released in May, but I gave up hope of seeing any of my friends again for a very long time once cases reached 200+ a day in my province in October and my mom forbade me from even meeting up with my best friend for a photoshoot.

I was able to get through the initial period of almost-total quarantine from March to May by video calling my friends frequently to work out, study, and play games, as well as stare at coronavirus memes all day (thanks, r/CoronavirusMemes!), but I don't know why things feel different this time. I noticed that lately I've been constantly talking to my friends about depressing topics like our ever-increasing number of COVID cases, celebrity deaths and other tragedies around the world, and everything that's been cancelled because of COVID. Some of them have been expressing worry about my well-being because of my pessimisticments, so I decided to stay off Facebook for a while to avoid putting a damper on their day and reduce distractions on my own end. But I think ahead to the holiday season and how I'm probably not going to be able to see anyone for Christmas and New Year's, and suddenly I don't even feel like doing anything with my friends virtually to ""celebrate"". Because I already video call my friends so often, it just doesn't really feel special to have a virtual ""party"" with them over the holidays for the specific purpose of celebrating Christmas or New Year's, only to do the same online activities with them that I've been doing for the past 8 months. In fact, I have already decided that I am going to sleep before 12 on New Year's Eve.

I don't know whether this is just me experiencing Zoom/video call fatigue and wanting to escape all the depressing COVID conversations I will inevitably engage in with my friends, or a sign that something is seriously wrong with me. I already deactivated my Instagram account, and have been avoiding Facebook for the most part over the past few days, simply working out and studying by myself instead of asking my friends to exercise or study with me through video call. And honestly, if it weren't for the fact that I basically need Facebook to stay in contact with a few of my classmates, I would have deactivated my Facebook account too. But I don't know why I suddenly don't want to talk to my friends anymore and just want topletely distance myself from other people, even virtually, until things start getting a bit better. And even with the recent vaccine news, I know things won't bepletely safe for a very long time, and I've been feeling pretty hopeless about life ever returning to ""normal"" or ever having anything to look forward to again.

I tend to stay up until around midnight-1 catching up on youtube content or throwing on a long twitch vod to fall asleep to. Usually it's enough to divert my attention, but sometimes it just doesn't quite do it, and I stay up way too late thinking about whether I have covid or not, even though I'm the least likely to contract it in my house (18M, starting college in January, no current job).

552,"Love isn't tourism. I took a very long flight - a follow up post. Hi everyone!

I posted a couple weeks ago, about taking a necessary long-haul. I'm happy to be writing from the other side of that experience, back home with my partner in our home. I don't know if this post quite belongs here, but I imagine there are other people who may appreciate the information.

I am a long-term visa holder in South Africa, and I've been waiting for more than a year and a half for the department of home affairs to approve my permanent residency (yes, it's infuriating as it sounds), which I have on the basis of having a South African partner. In spite of ample proof of living and cohabitating with my partner for seven years in Cape Town, I happened to be visiting a dying relative in the USA in March and that got me shuttered out of going home for over seven months. I am certain that I am fighting off a full blown case of PTSD from this experience, and I had a legal fight that I still don't have a deliberation from on the processing of my application even now. Finally though, sometime in October, the South African government approved long-term visa holders to return to the country. I realize these circumstances might be somewhat specific, but I've had a really hard year and if this information even helps one person it would be worth writing this out.

On Wednesday Oct 28th I had a flight booked going from New York to Cape Town, via Amsterdam, through Delta but operated by KLM. There is a standard going around many places in the world that to fly one has to have proof of a negative covid test taken less than 72 hours beforehand. This was somewhat tricky to secure, partly because the timing meant I had to find somewhere to take it first thing the Monday morning before. I highly suggest that anyone doing this call around and be polite but insistent about test results. It was certainly nerve wracking, as I only received the necessary document the same morning that I flew, but my extremely clearmunication up front that I was traveling and had a highly specific time frame proved to be what eventually got me what I needed.

TSA wasn't as tense as I expected it would be, and honestly not too different from pre-covid procedures (I've traveled internationally many times in my life). I flew at night, so the airport was somewhat empty, which was afort to me. Although there is signage in the airport about keeping masks on, I don't think it's very strongly enforced. There were an unsettling number of people with their masks fully off in the terminal, or taking off their masks to talk on their phones. A lot of people who were sleeping took off their masks. While I realize that most people in the airport will have needed negative tests to get through, there is no global standard for traveling during covid, and different places have different requirements... some do not require a negative test at all. I stayed distanced from people because of this. I also kept my mask on for the entire time, moving it aside only slightly to slip a silicone straw underneath to drink smoothies when I got hungry. This proved to be reeeally useful, though somewhat imperfect, and made me feel safer while still being able to hydrate and have some sustenance.

The first leg of my trip was about seven hours in the air. Meals have all but been eradicated, particularly if you're like me and have food allergies/preferences, but again, used a flexible reusable straw and just powered through it. The plane itself was fairly empty. I overheard an attendant telling someone that they seated people in a specific way for takeoff in order to balance weight inside the plane, but they allowed and even encouraged passengers to spread out once we had reached elevation and they took the seatbelt signs off. There was enough space that many people took up entire rows and slept for the majority of the flight, which is what I did as well. I've read about cabin air being filtered and cycled, but masks are still very much necessary - I felt a huge relief when an attendant went to a person sitting in front of me who hadn't even been wearing a mask in the terminal and told them that they must wear one on the flight.

I had a short hour and a half-ish layover in Amsterdam, where I changed my clothes, switched my mask and almost immediately got onto the next leg of my flight. This leg was 12 hours long. The flight was much more crowded, but even on this one most people had the ability to take up their own row in the cabin. There were a few people traveling in small groups (including a couple families with young children). This is where I began to really feel the recycled cabin air, specifically that it's DRY. My very minorplaint on this is that it kind of hurt my eyes and my nose where I had a scratch in my nose from the covid test I had taken shortly before, but of course, this is also a safety measure, one that I'm ultimately glad is in place on most planes. I tried to sleep as much as I could on this flight too. Overall I can't claim that it was exactlyfortable, but I will say it was manageable.

At the border, I landed late Thursday evening (time difference affected this), and had been transiting for over 20 hours at that point including going through the airports. Getting back through the South African border was nerve-wracking, because I was so afraid of being sent back to the US, but fortunately it all worked out and I got through just fine. I've been quarantining for more than a week, only going out a couple times to get food and necessities. I'll probably quarantine for most of this week too just to be safe, but I have felt okay, no signs of covid, just re-integrating and having a calm moment in what's been a chaotic year of my life. I am considering taking another lab test soon, but I have no reason to suspect covid at this point (there don't seem to be any rapid tests available in Cape Town yet).

In case anyone is curious, here are the masks that I bought and used specifically for my flight home. They're great and I honestly rmend them just forfort and every-day wear:

[

And here are the silicone straws I bought and used:

[

I think for flights that are fairly short, like a few hours, it would probably be easiest and safest to just wear your mask the whole time, but I wanted some kind of solution because my transit was so lengthy. It's imperfect, and yes it's risky to move your mask around at all, but I felt safer I would have removing my entire mask to eat.

I just want to say this to whoever might NEED to take a flight soon... please continue to follow precautions, and don't expect any work arounds for the rules. I'd even say that you'd be better prepared expecting that things don't always line up very smoothly, because this is all new, and again, there's no standard yet. Masks and guidelines are here to protect us, and I believe air travel will keep changing for a while, probably until there is a working vaccine. I fully suspect that someday when more accurate rapid-tests are developed, they will be as standard as any other TSA measure, but they are not perfect and it is still very important to follow the other precautions that are available. Masks are more than a courtesy at this point, they are a necessary measure to protect yourself and others from this thing, and I want nothing more than to keep hearing stories of people being reunited with their loved ones.

554,"For those mentally struggling, as I am, with everything going on and changing every day I know everyone is dealing with different situations in terms of lock down, stay at home orders, etc.  I know I am not the only one who was been immensely depressed and broken mentally.  From being SO so so almost unbearably lonely, to not being able to get out of bed, to breaking down crying constantly from either news outlets, loved ones getting COVID, etc etc, it's been really rough to find the motivation to do anything.  So I came up with three lists that I have in a notebook, ready for me whenever I start feeling down.  On three separate pieces of paper I have ""Ways To Make Money"", ""Ways To Stay Busy And Happy"", and ""Ways To Be Active"".

All three lists are things I can do from home and that I have immediate access to!  I make sure my notebook is visible on my desk at all times, so whenever I get even the slightest sense of a depressive episodeing on, I can grab it and get started immediately :)

On ""Ways To Make Money"" I also list ways to HELP me make money (certain ways I can be more organized with work, cleaning my work space, creating work ""goals"", etc).  ""Ways To Stay Busy And Happy"" are just small hobbies or things I'd like to start doing, as well as therapeutic activities like cleaning or doing my makeup.  ""Ways To Be Active"" speaks for it itself, but I have listed specific exercises or different routes to take on a walk.

I also want to add I think it's important to be somewhat specific as well!  At least for me that's what works :)  Because I know I get overwhelmed if I see ""baking"" (for example) instead of having ""bake an apple pie"", in my brain it just makes it easier.  I don't know if that makes a lot of sense, but it really does help to have a specific task you can tackle ASAP.

&#x200B;

  

If someone new told you they wanted to be more than Instagram friends what would you say?

Who are you to demand something like that? Would you ghost them? Would you be scared?

Would you think they were clingy?  Does that statement alone make you feel smothered?

Or could you appreciate someone wanted a true friendship or relationship with you?  The 6 years of depression loneliness despair the feeling of not fitting in, feeling like I had to improve myself before I could find anyone was destructive. Back when I was 20 I felt this loneliness crushing but I suppressed it keeping tight lipped for whatever reason maybe I felt macho, that the pain would go away not to mention my sister was going through her own depression and was in a bad place so maybe that had something to do with. The ages were 20-24 notpletely miserable though spaced with periods of isolation and going to school as distractions, It felt like I was still going somewhere in Life. The problem arose with lack of connections and from 24-25 feeling lost and majorly depressed. Been in therapy since 25-26 made major progressions and major strides, finding positivity in the gym to the point it was the only thing that was keeping my alive, it was funny when people would tell me that I was so dedicated.  It was only a band aid like popping depression pills, if you don’t fix the major problem everything is about to ooze out eventually, as you can’t keep using band aids to fix deeper problems.

Started to feel jaded, went to meet groups like volleyball nothing really materialized, only acquaintances, at least it got me out of the house. Kind of started stopped believing in people, started to hate the greeting how are you as it had no substance behind it. I was unemployed and dropped out of college at this point, using the regular vices as a form of escape from the pain. 

Fast forward at 26 coronavirus hit as I felt lonely still seeing how everyone had mates to get them through the lockdown that when the gyms reopened it was like seeing Jesus or something. I started to use the social media to connect with people the thing that was making me depressed but now that I think about if you use it properly it can still be a nice tool. When I was 18 I remember deleting Facebook because I knew no one gave a sheit about me. The constant want to delete social media but wanting to stay still connected with a few is always there. 

Now for that question above, I wasn’t depressed at this point more numb, to outside people it may just looked like I was always pissed that I would never smile. I heard it before, “you can smile” and “you’re always ok. The thing is I don’t need someone when I’m Happy but when I’m down. The problem when you’re lonely you can’t see things properly, so when I went on date and I thought someone cared it was like taking a drug.. the dopamine levels increased , to point where I can’t remember where I was that happy before, you just radiant differently, and people could tell , people would say hi before they would walk just past me beforepletely… and I didn’t even have to say hi first. I couldn’t see this from real perspective instead of being infatuated, and not feeling lonely anymore.  Long story short had fun but not romantically interested…. No worries I told her at first, but I let past experiences take over and told her I wanted to be more than Instagram friends (I am the one who suggested to be friends first as I didn’t want to be alone again) I got ghosted. All the pain that I thought I left behind came back the first three months I felt likeplete shit, loneliness to the point of shaking but as of now, I can look back as good learning experience. During covid I’m tapping into my natural Introverted abilities to keep busy but I don’t shy away from social interactions, I’ve been more bold asking people to work out at the gym, to even asking a girl on the street if she wanted to be friends( not a natural way but conventional ways haven’t worked LOL). I tried to keep the friendship, spilling how I had depression but she said nope but not everyone can understand, as I messaged her few times. I only reason I said something so forward its happened to before people just turned into instagram friends to being ghosted… but you know keep trying or some shit.

As of now (November 2020) I quit my retail job because my boss was pissing me off and the above was getting to me, and even though I feel this feeling of feeling behind, I’m going to go back to school in Jan to finish my degree and see what happens from there.

Nothing is Guaranteed in life and maybe that’s the most scary part (even if you try all your might) but I do know the two things that make me happy Deep connection and traveling. If I can’t find it here maybe it’s time to hit the road. Depression and Loneliness are something I wouldn’t wish on anyone the most pain I ever felt in my life (and I’ve had a car door slammed on my finger). Sadly I don’t feel there’s any less of stigma, and to everyone else just listen it’s not your job to fix peoples problem but listening can be the most helpful thing you could ever do.

561,"Want to see my dear sister, but feeling conflicted My much older sister who practically raised me has developed some health problems recently. Her doctor doesn’t say that she only has a certain amount of time left, but she says it’s not unthinkable that it could get serious very quickly.  So they are monitoring my sister closely because of her advanced age.  We haven’t seen each other since the pandemic began and I’m afraid I won’t get to see her again.

I want to go and visit her (I live in northwest Canada, she lives in southeastern US). I read that the US no longer has a quarantine period for travelers from Canada, but she lives in an active assisted living facility on her own, and they require a minimum 14-day quarantine period for all visitors arriving from any foreign country. Canada also requires a 14-day quarantine period when I return meaning even if I only have one day to see her, I’d need a month off from my job.  My job won’t grant that.

So I was thinking that because the facility doesn’t limit her ability to go out in public (if she promises to wear a mask and follow all the health/hygiene guidelines), would it be immoral or dangerous or just a bad idea if I arrived in Alabama, stayed at a hotel, and waited for a few days – and then just had a taxi bring her to see me at the hotel, outside, with masks, 6 feet apart, no touching? Or to push things even further, if we met outdoors and had washed our hands thoroughly beforehand, could I at least hold her hand for a few seconds? Or even further, could we both hold our breath and hug for a few seconds if we had showered immediately before meeting, and also washed or sanitized our hands? What makes me the most sad is the fact that I might never get to touch or hug her again.

I am not in great health and not young, so it might be foolish of me to be flying now. But I want to have this possibly last chance to touch her, to see her, because she was like my mother. On the other hand I also know that I could never live with myself if my selfishly breaking the rules was responsible for passing Covid-19 to her *AND/OR* the facility she lives in, which could result a disaster for so many people and families.

With the Holidays around the corner, I just wanted to remind you all that you can still be with your family for the Holidays, despite the pandemic. I’d rmend talking to extended family members that don’t live in your household about your concerns. Make a plan with anyone attending your event to make smart decisions a week or two before the event, to limit the risk of exposure. 

Now I understand everyone has different health concerns, and if you feel unsafe, you have no obligation to attend. Your family should understand and respect that. If you don’t attend a family gathering, make plans to Zoom or Skype. Stay connected.

I write this because I think no one should have to spend the holidays alone. Again, I just wanted to spread some positivity here.

They are okay, coughing,  fever, headaches but thank god no one  needed to go to the ER or  something. they are mostly healthy, except for high blood pressure for one of them, a bit overweight (but very active!) on both of them, and mental exhaustion because of a family death recently.

I'm  kinda afraid now. I  didn't realize until now, how anyone, no matter  how careful you are,  can get it. i'm also worried about long term  effects. The testers said  to treat it like the flu and to quarantine.  (we're not in america btw)

So  things: what can i do to make it easier on them?

also: please take my worries.. if they have been okay so far are they going to be okay? what are the long term effects for someone their age?

I graduated college in 2019. In college, I never went a weekend without a party or at least a big get together with friends. I was so social, I was so happy.

Then I graduated and moved to a new city for a job. I knew no one and had virtually no coworkers. I had no money and no car. I was so lonely, but eventually things got a little better and I started to make friends with cars.

Then boom, coronavirus. I moved home with my family because there was no reason to spend 2/3 of my paycheck on rent when all my coworkers and 'friends' left our city. I have no friends here and only occasionally see my boyfriend who lives two hours away.

My boyfriend just casually told me that his coworkers invited him over for drinks and I burst into tears. I miss hangouts so badly. I miss my friends. I miss college. I miss my life.

568,"I don't believe it will get better I was incredibly quiet and shy growing up. I was so shy that I refused to speak in school. When people asked me questions, I would always try to respond nonverbally. The other kids started to think that I was mute, that I was actually incapable of speaking. They would always ask me to open my mouth to prove to them that, yes, I have teeth and a tongue. One kid was so fed up with me that he followed me out to the playground during recess one morning and tackled me to the ground, yelling ""talk!"" 

I got slightly better at socializing, but that's not saying much considering where I started. I still faced bullying, both physical and verbal, on an almost daily basis. I spent a significant amount of time alone, and it only got worse with time. By the time I reached Jr. High School, most of my life was confined to my room. The very same room that I'm sitting in right now. I spent most of my time on the internet, just like I do now. 

All of this is to say that I understand the new normal, because it's closer to my old normal than I think it is for most people. I don't think I need to tell you that it's a depressing, lonely, unfulfilling, joyless, not-sure-if-its-worth-it existence. Imagine going entire weeks or months without having a single meaningful interaction with another human being. That's what I'm talking about. But at least in the past I could get some social interaction with other people at work. At least there was always hope that I could get better and find a better life. But those hopes have been slowly extinguished since March 2020. 

I just feel like we've opened Pandora's box. People have seen this new digital world and think they like it. I say think because I started out that way. When I started using the internet, I wished everything could be online so I didn't have to deal with in-person school. When I started working, I wished that could be online as well. But now I am absolutely sick to death of it. I want to feel like a real human being and not just some zombie sitting on aputer 24/7, because that's all life has been.

I'm not convinced that it will ever get better. Even when the vaccines roll out and restrictions are lifted, what we'll be left with is a barely recognizable facsimile of 2019. The economy will be in such dire straights, everyone will be so strapped for cash, that there will be no time for socializing. Even if there was, no one would be able to afford to go anywhere or do anything. Every restaurant besides the big fast food chains will close because they were hit so hard by the restrictions. Every movie theatre will close. Musicians won't be able to afford to tour. Airlines will go out of business. Hotels will go out of business. There could be mass unemployment and probably inflation to top it off. 

I just don't know what to think. Everyone says things will get better in spring, but what if springes along and everything is the same? What then? I can't do this until 2022, I certainly can't do it forever. Even a hermit like me used to have some interaction and it was the only thing keeping me sane.",29,0.91,jq5s3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jq5s3e/i_dont_believe_it_will_get_better/,12,Support,2020-11-08,-3,157,-0.01910828025477707

580,"House hit by COVID Hey everyone, I (24F) just found this subreddit and I'm needing some support.

So I live in a cooperative house, which means 15 of us of varying ages (although most of us are in our mid to late 20's besides a few people) all live in a house, share meals and spend considerable amount of time together. When the pandemic started we created a list of policy's to try to mitigate risk. We don't allow outside people inside the house (besides repair people wearing masks). Still some of us have had to return to work and we have spent time with friends (socially distanced), some of us have traveled, and we still have to make trips to stores. So really it was only a matter of time until one of us got it and likely spread it to others in the house. I have been dreading this day for months. I'm already someone who struggles with anxiety and I have been terrified of getting sick and possibly spreading it to loved ones (mostly my parents who are older, live nearby and who I see regularly albeit we only spend time together outside socially distanced).

So this week finally, one of my housemates reported covid symptoms to all of us, got a rapid test (he's a nurse), and it came back positive yesterday. Now we all as a house have to quarantine together and we had to have an emergency virtual house meeting to figure out how we're going to get through these next few weeks. Almost all of us got tested yesterday and while a handful of results areing back negative, another housemate reported waking up with symptoms (he hasn't gotten his results back). We are all now wearing masks outside our rooms, no longer having meals together, and mostly keeping away from each other. This whole situation just sucks so much and I feel like I am trapped inside a germ bomb. I had to tell my job, which is an in person position with an at risk population, that I can't work for at least two weeks now. I am scared because I was at my parents house helping them paint their garage the day my housemate reported symptoms, although I was wearing a mask and was outside the whole time. It feels like my worst fears areing true. One of my housemates is in his 70's and isn't very good about washing his hands all the time and wearing a mask. It feels like we're all going to get sick no matter what we try to do to stop it from spreading. I'm going to be confined to my room for weeks and I already feel like my emotional state is spiraling. I guess I just need some reassurance or some advice for getting through this. Does anyone have experience getting through COVID while in a congregate living situation? I'm a fairly healthy and young person and have been taking vitamin D supplements in the event that this happened so I think I will be okay but with everything I've read it feels like a total gamble.

581,"sick of people being told things will go back to normal... I'm not trying to be pessimistic. I just mean that this entire year has changed everyone's trajectory in profound ways. It is frustrating that any time I try to mention anything I am sad about in that regard, I get shut down. My parents are incredibly dismissive, and don't understand why at my age that this has been so hard for me. They keep telling me I'm young so it doesn't matter. I was struggling before all this, and was just getting my life together. This entire year I've been locked up at home. Our lockdown lasted 9 months here. I am glad we did lockdown, and I'm glad my government takes it seriously. But idea that we are just supposed to suck it all up, and be ok. Is ridiculous. 

I can cope with it, but I don't have to like it... and I have to grieve for the person I was, because this year has changed who I am. I can't go back. I have never been so alone as I have this entire year, not a single person reached out to me. My family is extremely abusive, and they are the only contact I have had. And I have been stuck for years, so I was already sick of waiting. Literally the very week lockdown eased up slightly, my mother starts berating me for being a loser with no direction in life... seriously... 

I will get through this, and this whole year, I've been working everyday to ensure that my life will be improved when this is over. But it is incredibly hard when the only people around me don't even care how I feel. 

The other thing is has really set me apart from a lot of family and friends the few I had left, much of my family have gone down the Qanon rabbit hole. And are antimaskers and believe it's a hoax. I had a few friends I lost for the same reason. This situation has just made politics even more toxic.

Okay so I (20)f tested positive for Covid on 8th September after my dad (55)M did, Both my parents are doctors so he probably got it through the hospital. After that things just got worse, My parents are separated so. I went to my mom's to isolate and after 3-4 days my dad got admitted into a hospital. Following days both my grandparents(who lived with my dad) also tested positive and were admitted. My brother (24)M who lives with my dad was then alone at home and he has been diagnosed with depression, suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety and OCD since a few years, so everyone was worried for him too but he managed himself. My mother who was also diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression many years ago took care of me during my isolation period. Then my brother suffered loss of taste and smell and started having panic attacks so my mom managed to get him at her place to look after him which was a task in itself because we couldn't touch him or be close to him. After a few days my dad got shifted to ICU and so did my grandfather. Then I myself recovered from Covid but got infected with another severe infection and was unable to eat and my mom had to literally give me meds through an insulin. After a week of me being sick and missing out on almost a month of college my dad and my grandmother got discharged from the hospital and went to his sister's place. My brother and I came back to my dad's place cos my brother wasn'tfortable staying at my moms. then after 2 weeks my brother and I went to visit our dad and our grandmother to my aunt's house and they told us that our grandfather passed away 20 days ago and they couldn't tell us because we were alone at home and they were worried. They also told me that while my father was in the ICU he was also at risk for a while about which I wasn't told and the doctors and everyone else was scared for him too and even now he has to take medications and has post covid damage. While i'm also stressing about college cos i missed 80 hours of lectures, I don't know but I envy all of my friends including my boyfriend. My best friend and my boyfriend were really supportive throughout this time but my boyfriend and his family+ family friends used to have these amazing dinners and fun nights for the major part of the quarantine and then he went out for Uni and even now is able to hang out with his friends and everything. While other people too that I personally am really close to have been going out and enjoying while I've just been at home from the start and nothing has happened to those guys, I don't want anything to happen to them but whenever my boyf. tells me he's going out to meet his friends although where he is things are much safer it pisses me off and I be a little rude towards him. It's not his fault but even now after recovering I haven't met a single soul and my home isn't a very happy place, It's not violent but it's just sad. So I just get mad and teary whenever I see everyone getting to do whatever they can while I'm in a house with college stress and family stress and just never ending misery.

I dont have many options as I cant take a COVID test for personal reasons. I'm nervous and it's difficult for me to even think right now. I know if I get COVID I'll have no choice but to die, and that's scary.

But here in the USA there's a lot of anti vaxxers and people who have lost faith in the fda's ability to handle the vaccine process.

585,"Is there a way to tell if I had COVID in February? Is the antibody test worth it? In mid February, my boyfriend got extremely sick. Since we live together, I inevitably got it, too. I had a cold in January, so I was pissed to deal with back to back sickness. I have a weak immune system and get sick multiple times of year. I knew I would eventually catch whatever he had, which only took 1.5 days before I started showing symptoms.

It started off with a persistent cough and high fevers, and within a couple days, we were both bedridden with extreme fatigue and all over body aches. I was dealing with loss of taste, chest pains, trouble breathing, headaches, loss of appetite, nausea, and extremely sore throat. I wasn't really sneezing or having a runny nose, but the cough and fever persisted. Whatever cold I had in January was a walk in the parkpared to this.

My boyfriend, who never gets sick, said it was the worst sickness of his entire life, and I agree. It took about two full weeks and three doctors visits for us to feel better. 

We tested negative for flu and strep, and the doctors basically said we have a respiratory infection or virus but they didn't know what it was. They said it could be pneumonia but we didn't do the test. They gave us antibiotics, steroids, and strong cough syrup and sent us on our way.

Then in March when things got crazy, we wondered if it was possible that we had covid and not an infection the month before. We never got tested for covid nor have we done an antibody test. My understanding of the antibody test is that it's unreliable.

I worry about the long-term effects of covid, which is why I want to know if we had it. I often feel like my chest is heavy and I have some trouble breathing (I have severe anxiety and panic disorder so it could also be related to that), and my boyfriend coughs a lot in the mornings which he never used to do. 

Is there a way to find out if we had it? Would an antibody test be reliable? It's been about 8 months.

586,"Always worried and scared Ive been on this reddit for some time so first id like to thank you all for the ongoing support and positivity for myself and others - even if I havent interacted. I also understand this is a support page and not a survivors page so ill do my best to not post anything too upsetting but I do feel I need support, however I'll warn some readers that this post may make some more anxious.

I need to at least give a short form version of my story in order to provide the context of why I'm so stressed and burnt out today. 

In March my wife and I had our first child. We went into the hospital March 10th when the world was normal, my baby was born March 12th, we left the hospital March 17th and the world had gone crazy. 1 month later my wife was diagnosed with pulmonary emboli AND covid19. She stayed in the hospital for 11 days while I looked after the baby. We had no help and have had no help due to us staying under strict quarantine from everyone we know including family. Now my wife did pull through. In fact she was not even on a ventilator. However she has now had ongoing symptoms for almost 7 months. And despite me testing negative, I have also had ongoing symptoms for almost 7 months. She has been tested numerous times for everything, blood work, heart, ct scans, ultrasounds etc and everything seems generally ok. However every sniffle or cough or muscle ache either one of us gets sends us into a tailspin that something awful is going to happen and I am so sick of being red lined with anxiety. And because we seem to get a new symptom of something almost daily we are constantly worried. We have had good weeks. Even 2 or 3 at a time where we think we have turned a corner but then something will happen. We try to tell ourselves that eventually things will turn around, that we are immune, no permanent damage is being done etc. But ultimately we obviously don't know because no one really seems to. We refuse to see *anyone* because we don't want to risk my wife's health even though we just will never know if the clots were covid related or from pregnancy (she had an emergency c section). Our family understands but my in laws do seem to live life like everything is normal and give us grief for not seeing their grand child.  

Anyways, I just am wanting to post this here because I dont want to express my worries to my wife who is already just as anxious as me every day. Plus we need to focus on caring for the baby. So I thank you all for your continued posts. It sucks, but its nice to know others are out there going through an equally rough year. I just keep praying and treating every day as its own test to get through. Every day neither of us are in the hospital is a blessing.

588,"Disappointed about the lack of support and guidance for people who live alone I feel like the people in power and members of the scientificmunity who speak to the media live with their families for the most part, and don’t understand how hard being alone could be. Whether it’s state websites or federal agencies, nobody has advice for dealing the mental burden of being alone for a long period of time. 

I’m very fortunate to live in a state where people are taking this seriously, and that I’m able to afford my own place anyways. In all honesty I enjoy living alone and not having roommate drama. I just don’t like being alone all the time. And now that case numbers are rising again, reliable online resources are scant. Although my state says it’s ok to gather with a certain number of people, I’m afraid that either things will change or that the government doesn’t have the willpower to lock down again

For instance, I’d like to know if forming a pod would be effective. A few friends said they’d be open to it, but that was a month ago and I haven’t seen them since in light of rising cases. I don’t want to infect anyone, but I don’t know how much longer I can be alone. FaceTiming is ok, but it’s just not the same as seeing people in person.

Also there’s no way I’m spending the holidays alone. Officials may say otherwise, but again, that’s because most of them have families of their own. I will get tested before driving to my mom’s house (about 2.5 hrs away, in a bordering state that I’d have to test neg to visit) and I may not even leave once I’m there. Again, my biggest priority is not infecting anyone, even though it’s probably only going to be immediate family. My mom wants me to stay at her house for a while, but I’m not sure if I want to do that. The last time I was home for more than a week, I remember just how eager I was to go home. My family is very loving, but things can get a bit dramatic at times.

I don’t know what the point of this was, except maybe to rant. I’m sure I’m not the only one who feels this way. Maybe people here can share what they’re doing to keep themselves busy, or what precautions they’re taking without losing their minds.

589,"Friend's sister works at a hospital which recently declared a small outbreak. Worried I may have been exposed. This is kind of aplicated situation and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting but I'm really worried as my sister has a 2 month old baby and my parents are in the risky age range. Any help or opinions is much appreciated.

I'll use fake names for clarity.

So my friend Jason's sister works at a local hospital which recently had declared an outbreak as 4 staff members (not in patient care) tested positive between Oct 31 to Nov 3rd.

The last time I was in a room with Jason was Oct 25th so I'm not too worried about him. Yesterday, my other friend George called me and told me about this outbreak as I had no knowledge about it prior. He told me that Jason called him and explained the situation to him; where Jason's sister has no symptoms, is not sure that she was in contact with anyone infected and is always in full personal protective equipment at all times. She is currently quarantined in her room waiting on her test results.

Both Jason and George hang out a lot, almost daily. I recently saw George yesterday which was the reason he called, as he knew I took covid pretty seriously due to the risk on my family. I only hung out with George for an hour in his car and I had a mask on for most of the time, but I did take it off to eat. I don't recall getting too close to him without my mask on but I'm still worried. I use hand sanitizer regularly and wash my hands as soon as I get home.

We talked about it and reasonably, I shouldn't be cautious but not super worried as nothing is certain with Jason's sister and I had very minimal contact with George. Even with all this, I'm really worried as this was the first time I've left the house in a month and I don't know what to do as everyone in my family is vulnerable.

Background: Guy in his 20s, spending practically all of his time alone at his apartment because the only thing worse than being isolated by yourself is being isolated with people you can't stand for more than a few days at a time. Still, not exactly enjoying my life as others are out there having fun (and getting infected, disabled and dying) while I keep rotting away with my already-poor social skills.

I work in a small law office (3 of us) and my coworker’s daughter was real sick over the weekend. My coworker has been sick since Monday, was out yesterday and got a covid test. She’s hoping to get results tomorrow, and it AT work, wearing a mask.

I’m also wearing a mask and sanitizing what I can and avoiding her as much as possible, but I feel like I’m about to have a panic attack.

I had covid during the spike in July and do not want it again or to bring it home to my fiancé. The coworker in question came into my office earlier to say she was feeling a lot better - she actually came to the office yesterday and looked exhausted, couldn’t talk much, and had (has) a gasping/wheezing cough. I’m about to cry at my desk, I’m so upset. We’ve all talked about covid so many times and everything she said indicated she was on the same page as me, which I would’ve expected includes “if you’re sick and waiting on test results, do note to work”

It is so fucking simple, I don’t understand how this is actually happening. I can see from the stuff on my desk that she was at MY desk printing something earlier, too. 

I want to just text my boss after I finish my work to say I finished my filing and am okay with missing a day of pay, I’m notfortable being in the office with someone waiting on results.

And it’s so fucking frustrating because I had covid in the spike in July and stayed my ass home, obviously. Before I even got tested! I was sick and having trouble finding tests, so I stayed home, got tested, and quarantined. Cases are the WORST they’ve ever been, and youe in sick?!

Like most of us, the pandemic's been super hard on my mental health. I've had chronic depression since I was 13 and this year was diagnosed bipolar II. I've been (virtually) seeing a therapist weekly and my psychiatrist monthly. I am getting worse and worse. My suicidal thoughts have be intrusive andpulsory. I don't want to act on them, I don't have a plan, but they're prevalent and it's concerning to me. My psychiatrist suggested a Partial Hospitalization Program, which runs 8:30 - 3 Monday through Friday, for one to four weeks. I called my insurance and they don't cover it until my deductible kicks in, at $2k in network and 4k out, and then they pay 80%/50%. My out of pocket max is $6500. Even more fun is that I found out my teletherapy/psychiatry copays were being waived due to the pandemic, not because that's what they cost, and all of my visits starting October 1 and onward will be billed at $60. That puts me at $540 through next week. I can't afford this.

My dentist opened back up in June, but I put off rescheduling my appointment because I was anxious about going in. Now I set up an appointment for Monday because I want to go in before things get bad again, but I'm really anxious about it and considering canceling again.

It's for a routine cleaning, but I have gum disease (slightly past the gingivitis stage, still early enough that I was able to receive preventative treatments) that I had to see my dentist like 4 times over two weeks last winter to get treated, and I was supposed to be on a 3-4 month cleaning schedule with her instead of 6 to make sure my gums weren't getting worse. Gum health is really important and I already have a tooth that had started to be loose so I really do not want to let it get worse (both for health and financial reasons - I cannot afford gum grafts, extractions, etc. at this point) but I'm very nervous about COVID even though they're screening patients, spacing out appointments, taking temps, etc.

So I'm just wondering if anyone here has been to a dentist recently and if you wouldn't mind sharing your experience as I try to decide what to do about my appointment.

Thanks!

612,"We lost a WWII veteran and wonderful man on Sunday. I'm afraid for the rest of my family and friends. I'm an emotional mixture of sad, angry and terrified.

&#x200B;

My husband's grandfather was 97, and despite being a resident of a nursing home he was healthy. He was there so that there would always be someone to help just in case he fell or needed anything. He still had his health and his mind. He was one of the kindest people I'd ever met. He and my father-in-law were even at my house on the Christmas of 2012, a month after my mother had passed away, trying to fix the furnace so that there would be heat in the house for winter. He was selfless and loved in themunity.

&#x200B;

Last week, he tested positive for Covid. Over half a dozen caretakers and over thirty other residents tested positive as well. I was scared then, but we kept telling ourselves that he had survived so much already. If anyone in this town could beat the odds, he would. He started to improve, but as this virus has shown he took a turn for the worst several days later. He was admitted to the local hospital, where he passed away just before noon on Sunday.

&#x200B;

My mother-in-law stayed with him (her father) for several hours one night in the hospital. I'm afraid for her, but at the same time I'm thankful that she was allowed in. I know that so many people never got the chance to say goodbye or to see their loved ones one last time. She is quarantining at home now, where there are two floors and two bathrooms so that contact with her husband can be limited.

&#x200B;

While I understand that a nursing home is a business, I was angry to learn that they were pressured to pick up his things. In this highly affected area. The billing cycle was over and they needed the room empty. Seriously? They plan to bring another resident into an environment currently infested with Covid? My father-in-law, who is immunpromised was the one to go load up his belongings. The staff put them outside and ""sprayed them down"" for them, whatever that amounts to. On the same day they got the news that he had passed. Within less than three hours.

&#x200B;

I'm terrified for both of my in-laws. They're the only parents I have left. I'm afraid for myself and my husband. I still go to work, although fortunately my manager understands how worried I am about the virus and she only schedules me if she has no other options. We disinfect and use bleach water or sanitizer to clean surfaces, but even that can only protect us so much with people refusing to protect others.

&#x200B;

One of my husband's sisters is a teacher. She is in quarantine now because she spent hours at a conference next to a person who later tested positive. She has a husband and four children, and I'm scared that she will be infected.

&#x200B;

My parents' sides of my family are older as well, and I can't help but be scared for them. One of my uncles is a pharmacist, who I know is taking every possible precaution and has closed the inside of his pharmacy (months ago) to do their sales through the drive thru only. My aunt, his wife, has MS and is so fragile and constantly in and out of hospitals as it is. I cannot imagine how worried he must be, but with the need to be strong and confident for my aunt who would surely not survive if infected with this virus.

&#x200B;

I'm just so angry with people who don't take this seriously until it effects them on a personal level. I'm so afraid that this loss is the first but not the last. I don't want to lose more family or friends. I just feel like it's hopeless to think we're going to make it through this safely. Life isn't normal and it won't be for a long time.

614,"I tested positive, and I'm struggling I tested on 10/29, and I received my results 11/3. I was SHOCKED to receive these results. I was exposed 10/22, but the chances of me getting it from that exposure were extremely small, which has me wondering where I else I could've gotten it from. Thankfully, I began my quarantine 10/23. I had itchy eyes and congestion starting around 10/21 I'd say (if I remember correctly, it's all a blur). Totally thought it was my allergies, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary for me. I only quarantined to ensure the safety of my parents/brother, and I continued to feel fine throughout this time, minus the occasional congestion (again, normal), headache (eye strain, would go away), and a quick sore throat (lasted 20 minutes when I first woke up, think I slept with mouth open). I am the absolute last person I would have expected to get a positive result - literally everyone I told thought I was joking because I am so strict on staying home. The exposure on 10/22 was the the first time I had been inside somewhere that wasn't my home since March. Unlucky, huh? Thankfully my dad and brother have tested negative, and my mom is awaiting her results. I am so worried for them. 

When I got my results yesterday, I noticed I had more symptoms than before (felt like I had to cough, some chest tightness, body aches). I wasn't surprised by this as I do have hypochondria and OCD, so knowing I was positive was bound to make my anxiety worse, which I knew would probably lead to some symptom progression. I just tried to think of how I felt absolutely fine in the days preceding. Thankfully, I don't have a temperature and my oxygen levels are great! Today, I feel fine again. No chest tightness or cough, no body aches. Today is Day 6 since my positive test, but I believe I'm ahead of day 6 based on symptoms alone. I told the contact tracer my symptoms started on 10/21 and she told me I didn't have to quarantine anymore since I passed the 14 day mark; I was surprised by this response, and I told her I will stay in isolation for 10 days from my positive test.

I am so grateful I feel physically fine, and I so hope I continue on this track. My anxiety, however, is horrible. I am terrified of getting sick, terrified of medical procedures, terrified of doctors, etc. It's been a nightmare. Reading through COVID19positive subreddit has been...far from helpful. It's made this so much worse tbh. I am *terrified* for the next few days, and I am *terrified* that I will have long-term problems. Nothing seems to help because everything I read is doom and gloom. I started a regiment of Vitamin D, Vitamin C, and Zinc yesterday. I realize the majority of the people on these types of subreddits are probably not having mild symptoms, so it's more of a confirmation bias, but I'm just...losing my mind. Can anyone offer words of advice orfort? Thanks for reading this far.

623,"Not sure how to deal with this... I need some input. I'm a new mom to a 3.5 month old baby. I live in BC, where cases are low inparison to the States, but they're rising consistently every day. Pre-COVID I was a social butterfly. I would have girls' nights with my friends, go out for meals, family gatherings, etc. But then the pandemic hit and I was pregnant. My anxiety around the whole situation was through the roof. My employer wasn't taking the situation seriously and I was so afraid of catching the virus at work that my doctor put me on medical leave. I'm now on maternity leave, so I'm still off work until July. I live with my husband, my parents and my brother and until very recently, we have avoided seeing my grandparents because we've been so afraid of passing something on to them. They're now in our ""bubble"". We see them indoors, but no physical contact. My outings consist of curbside pick ups, and on the very odd occasion, I'll run into a store if I have to. My baby stays in the car with someone or at home while someone watches her. She has yet to enter an establishment.

My sister-in-law is a teacher, so we stopped seeing her and the rest of my husband's side of the family just before school started again in September. During the time we did see them prior to September, it was always outside and we asked them to wear masks to hold the baby. 


Now it's November and my husband's family wants to get together. They're very stressful to be around even without a pandemic, and the added stress of the virus makes seeing them almost unbearable. They wear masks when holding the baby, but when someone isn't holding her, they still get in her face and talk to her. I'm struggling with being too assertive because I don't want to seem overly protective and like I'm being dramatic or causing issues, but inside I'm screaming.

They aren't from ourmunity and aren't in our bubble. They're also from an area that has some of the highest number of cases. We told them prior to school starting again that we don't want to have visits right now, but it hasn't stopped them from asking to see us. They're laying the guilt on thick. I feel bad that they don't get to see their grandchild and neice, but I feel like it's their own selfishness driving this. If they were as concerned about her safety as myself and my husband, they wouldn't want to see us either. But they say ""we're covid free!"" and make jokes.

They also want to know if we're celebrating Christmas together. I don't know howfortable I feel about that either because we'll be inside. This is our baby's first Christmas, and I don't want to take that away from them. I feel sick about this whole thing.

I know I need to protect my family, but how do I go about navigating these situations? I'm a people pleaser and don't like to cause conflict. I know seeing them would PROBABLY be okay. But is it worth taking a risk? How long do we do this for? This situation is causing me so much stress.

624,"Need a little help with anxiety. Ok. So this might be a little long. Some backstory.

Im 31, fixing to be 32 in December. Back in February I went to the doctor and weighed in at 336 lbs, and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. My A1C was 8.5. Along with that my triglycerides were through the roof and everything else thates along with being obese.

I know that this is an option to live the lifestyle that I have so I decided then that I was going to make a change for the better. I started eating better. Basically doing a keto diet. I'm not only doing it for me, but I have 3 awesome little girls, 12 and under. I want to watch them grow up as long as possible.

Fast forward to now. I recently went back to the doctor to check A1C levels again. I was on 2 500mg extended release metformin. My A1C has dropped to 6.5 so she backed me down to 1 pill in the morning. Im also down to 304 lbs. So I have lost a total of 32 lbs. She said everything is starting to level out and all my blood work looks ALOT better. To keep doing what I'm doing and in 6 months I may be able to cut out the medspletely. As in reversing the Type 2 diabetes.

At the beginning of this whole pandemic I shrugged it off mostly. I live in a very very rural area so to date in my town we've only had like 400 cases. We are at the most active cases currently ever here which is 65. We've had 2 deaths since it began. Both older with underlying health conditions.

My problemes in when I am watching the news or reading headlines about Covid. I know that Im at an increased risk but I have no idea how much. The news/headlines put all Diabetics/Obese/Hypertensive people in 1 box. As this goes on I'm starting to feel very anxious every time I think about it. We do our best to social distance. Ordering grocery pickup and things of that nature. My wife thankfully has a job that has allowed her to work from home along with myself. My kids are virtual as well for the time being.

I cant kick the feeling that if I catch it something is going to happen. The thought of not watching my daughters grow up, and leaving my wife breaks my heart. They're all really healthy. I've tried to stay up to date with headlines and news articles so I've stocked up on Vitamin D, C, and I'm taking Fish oil to help lower my Triglyceride levels. The anxious feeling is extremely overwhelming sometimes and the news doesn't help. Its always doom and gloom. I guess I'm looking to find out from someone how high risk I really am to help with my anxiety somewhat.

I know that my lifestyle was a choice I made in the past and I'm confident that I can reverse this disease and go back to being healthy as its not really a choice at this point, its a must. Any help or insight is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance and sorry for the long read.",1,0.67,jo4p2g,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jo4p2g/need_a_little_help_with_anxiety/,9,Support,2020-11-05,-7,170,-0.041176470588235294
625,"At this point it feels like my mental health is going to be the death of me and not Covid. I've officially lost my sanity. It's gotten so bad I've had to get rid of my social media because all what's been on it lately is Covid and politics. 

My lack of social life has really gone down. I've not seen anyone in person other than my family, girlfriend and co workers. Sure I'm grateful I have my girlfriend in my life, but there's only so much we can do. Before there were loads of things to do, but the best thing for people to do right now is well hardly anything. Since anything other than normal would be putting the family at risk.

Perhaps if I lived on my own with her I would try to live my life (with precautions of course), but my family is so concerned about the pandemic they don't want anyone traveling or going to see people. So of course I'm doing my part in keeping them safe, but let me tell you my mental health will kill me before Covid does. 

I already feel dead inside. I just wake up to do what I normally do, but with loads of restrictions that's keeping me from doing the things I love. I've even been having more breakdowns lately and have been isolating myself more from people cause it's hard wanting to wake up to this awful world we are currently living in.",134,1,jnf6l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jnf6l1/at_this_point_it_feels_like_my_mental_health_is/,36,Support,2020-11-04,-7,54,-0.12962962962962962

627,"I feel like I'm running out of time to make the most out of high school &#x200B;

I've never used Reddit before, but I feel like this would be a good place to dump what's going on in my head right now.

I'm currently going through my sophomore year. My school is using a mixture of remote and in-school learning, basically working by having online meetings on Mondays, going to school on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, then remotely doing school on Thursdays and Fridays. It's basically justpleting an entire workload your teachers give you. I hate it. I hate it so much. It's not even that much work, but how can I even keep focus when there's no teachers to tell me to stop googling random things on myputer and put away my phone? It's like I'm stuck in a constant cycle. On Wednesdays when I'm walking out of school, I always think to myself ""Alright, I'm going to wake up early tomorrow and finish all the work I have to do in my A day classes. Then, the day after that, I do the work for my B classes."" It never turns out like that. Instead, I end up putting it off again and again. I spend Wednesday looking at my phone, having moments where I put it away in my room and go downstairs to work. I work for about one hour before deciding to take a 10-minute break that evolves to a break that lasts the whole entire day. I put it off that day thinking that I have tons of hours to catch up on what I didn't do the next one. I've tried so many things, I've tried beating myself up and calling myself a moron for not being able to finish writing one paragraph with all the tremendous amounts of time I have. I have tons of pressure right now because I have three Cs, and although three Cs don't seem like absolutely awful grades, the people around me are holding me to a high standard because of how academically successful I was my first year.

But the worst part is that ""missing out"" feeling. I've searched up stuff like ""when is the coronavirus going to end"" and ""will we wear masks and social distance forever"" because I just want it to end. I view high school as an extremely important part of your life and one that you should always make the most of and be able to smile back on. Freshman year seemed like a great start - I got an Academic Letter Award and I decided to join my school's marching band which helped me make new friends and was a massive highlight of that year. I expected to hate it, but it ended up being amazing. This year, though, ispletely different. All the activities I did last year arepletely watered down and everything that made them fun is now ripped away. All my friends go to school on different days, so I barely socialize with anyone. One of my classes was originally based on learning to kayak in the pool, but they closed it, so now we just run through everything we did last year. I know that this is absolutely nothingpared to the current seniors and especially last year's seniors who are having one of the most important years of their high school experience ripped away from them, and I know this is most likely going to end sometime during my junior year (and obviously this is nothingpared to those losing their loved ones). However, that doesn't matter to me. I just want it to end already and go back to normal so I can go back to actually liking high school again. I took a normal life for granted so much. Current life feels so empty and without meaningpared to last year.

I even heard that our school has the chance of goingpletely online. I want anything but that. I don't want to stay holed up on aputer screen. I try to stay hopeful, but as I see the numbers go up, I keep wondering just how long this will last. 

So, please, does anybody have anything to help me cope with this feeling? Any advice on how to deal with my procrastination problem? How do I make all these hours I spend inside my house mean something?

Neither of us are in a risk group, and we both have been following Covid safety measures since the beginning of the pandemic, as we are aware of the risks of getting infected or spreading it to others. While we both agree on the importance of taking precautions,  she's deathly afraid of the virus and believes we should act to nullify the chances of getting infected, at the expense of everything else. We haven't met anyone since March, been having groceries delivered to us 90% of the time, and she almost never leaves the house, not even to go for a walk outside. She doesn't mind, as she's an introvert and feels just fine staying home watching tv and reading all day. She does have some friends, but they have been mostly ignoring the pandemic, so she doesn't even consider the possibility of meeting them.

She's around pretty much 24/7 (the only alone time I get is when I leave the house to stroll). I don't get any time alone, and don't really feelfortable talking to my friends online through videocall, as I feel like she might listen to our conversations.

This has been taking its toll on me, but it's not all there is to it. I'm also really annoyed I haven't been able to meet anyone, as she's afraid I might get the virus from whoever I meet, regardless of the circumstances (as in her opinion, any chance of getting infected is too much. As a result, I haven't been able to see my grandparents (and great-grandparents) since February. I'm really afraid of them getting infected and dying before I get to see them, as they have been going out to buy food, and meeting some of my family at home. My mother doesn't care to see them, and I haven't been able to get her to allow me to visit them, as she's afraid they might get infected but asymptomatic, and that they'll infected me and I'll bring it to her.

I just don't know what to do. It would be much easier if I were living alone, but I can't just suddenly find somewhere to live (and she wouldn't let me leave anyway, as she says she needs me for support if anything happens to her). I've been thinking of just telling her I'm going out to visit my family, but if I did that and got infected, she would raise hell from me getting it and passing it to her, and I would have nowhere to go.

639,"I'm in quarantine. My wife is taking this **hard**. For context, we just bought a house at the beginning of October. I was set to travel out-of-state for work on Oct 14th. So I did as much as I could before I left; from fixing little things like faulty outlets to installing new ceiling fans and light fixtures and also some light plumbing repair. Then I'm on the road for two weeks.

One week into my travel,  on Saturday evening, Ie down with a mysterious ailment. Fever, chills, congestion, nausea, headache so bad my freaking face hurt, and general upper body aches. These symptoms lasted for only about 12 hours, and then they just kind of dissipated. Weird, right? By Sunday night I felt much better, with only the upper body aches persisting. So I cancel the remainder of my trip and came home to get tested for the 'Rona (seems I could not get a test in the state I was in because I did not live there. WTF. Anyway.). 

Drive 8 hours back ""home"" on Monday, stay the night in a hotel and get tested the next day. Stay holed up in the hotel 5 miles from my new house for a couple of nights until the test resultse back, which they did on Thursday. Negative. But wait! Weren't my symptoms highly indicative of a covid infection??? Phoned up a doctor on Teledoc. Doctor says get another test or stay quarantined for 10 days according to CDC. So I schedule another test for Friday (the drive-up CVS nose swab test). So at the minimum at this point I'm stuck at the hotel until Tuesday (10 days asymptomatic) or until I get a second negative, whicheveres sooner.

At this point, I've lived more in a hotel room than in my new house. My wife is struggling to keep up with chores and what-not, on top of her **extremely** demanding job, and she's quickly reaching a breaking point, but I dare not expose her (and my live-in mother-in-law to any possible exposure of the 'Rona as they are both immunpromised.

I got my first results back in 2 days, but I'm still waiting for the second results. Hopefully I get another negative and can go home tomorrow, but if not, I'll be here until Tuesday. My wife is all ""you cane here and stay socially distant and do stuff like mowing and taking out garbage and this and that, but I don't want to unnecessarily expose my family to anything, and we got into a fight about it tonight.

644,"COVID-19 Testing: Basic Information and Q&A Hey Everyone! With elections just around the corner, Halloween this year was extra spooky and scary!!

First and foremost, thank you everybody for helping build a supportivemunity. Your willingness to support and help others is why ourmunity flourishes! We want to continue improving the subreddit by implementing new strategies and resources. Starting this week, we plan to identifymon themes and topics, and creating a sticky-thread to provide a better, well-rounded answer.

**This week's topic is COVID-19 testing and basic information on how testing for diseases works.**

We’ve recently noticed a lot of question and confusions around how COVID testing works, concerns over media reports that tests may not be entirely accurate, and whether you can really trust the result your tests show. This post aims to help you navigate some of that confusion.

In a perfect world, we would have a perfect COVID-19 test that would identify every COVID case with no false-negative or false-positive. Unfortunately, our world is not perfect, and COVID-19 tests less than ideal.

Bear in mind that we are in the middle of an unexpected pandemic. Because we are currently dealing with the COVID19 pandemic in real-time, it is extremely important and emergent to detect and identify cases. The countries that have handled the outbreak best tend to be those who introduced testing early, such as [Germany]( and [Singapore.]( This is where **Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)**es in\*\*.\*\* During a public health emergency, The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can grant a specific COVID test EUA authority when certain criteria are met. More importantly, an EUA is granted to a test when there are no better, or adequate alternatives available. In short, COVID tests have flaws, but they are the best tests we have, and widespread COVID testing is **crucial to** **mitigate** further progression and spread of COVID. COVID Testing provides information for COVID surveillance and tracking. Despite a flawed test with potential false-negatives/false-positives, they are currently the best tests to stop the pandemic.

It is extremely important you go see your doctors and/or notify your doctor if you are concerned that you have COVID-19. Screening tests will have some false-negatives and false-positives – depending on how valid and accurate the test is, which we will go over later – but it is crucial not to interpret results yourself.  A result of a test does not confirm an illness, and doctors do not always diagnose strictly from a positive result. In addition to the test result, doctors perform a full history and physical examination and look for further evidence of COVID-19. Combined, this gives a much better idea of whether or not the patient has had COVID-19. **Notify your doctor if you're concerned. Not only would it offer an accurate result, it would also allow surveillance, tracking, and prevention of COVID-19.**

&#x200B;

**Different COVID-19 Tests and How They are Administered**

· **Viral Test –** Tests that **tells you if you have a current infection**. Viral tests are your nasal/oral swabs, or saliva tests. These tests detect for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a patient.  They are rmended to test symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, to guide contact tracing, and isolation requirements Some tests are point-of-care tests.

· **Serology /Antibody Test –** Test that ***might*** **tell you if you had a past infection.** Antibody tests are tests that draws your blood, and typically done at a clinic, or a doctors office your blood by looking for antibodies, which may tell you if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibodies normally takes 1-3 weeks after infection to develop, therefore antibody tests are **not used to diagnose current COVID-19 infection**.  One exception is if a viral test is delayed, and an antibody test yields positive while the patient is showing symptoms.

· **Point-of-Care (POC) tests –** These are the tests people mainly get at drive-throughs, pharmacies like CVS/Walgreens, health clinics, etc. POC tests are fast and rapid tests, often providing a result within within a couple days.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/**Real-life Scenarios Where You Should Consider COVID Testing:**

I'll place emphasis on Viral Antigen Tests being that they are moremonly used in the public setting and more important for patients as these tests for current COVID-19 Infection. [Here is CDC website on what a COVID-19 Antibody Test can Tell Us](

**When You SHOULD Test for COVID:**

1. **If you have symptoms of COVID-19**
2. **If you have been in close contact (Less than 6ft for at least 15 minutes) with a COVID positive Person**
3. **If you work in a nursing home or receive care in one**

**When You or your Physician may Consider COVID Testing**

1. **If you may be exposed, or if you live with someone vulnerable of severe illness**
2. **If you attended a public/private gathering of more than 10 people without proper masking and physical distancing**

**Scenarios When you Don't Need a COVID Test**

1. **If you had a positive test less than 3 months ago**
2. **If you previously asymptomatic or mild symptoms that did not worsen, you did not require hospitalization, AND it has been at least 10 days after your symptom started and your fever has resolved for at least 24 hours** 

&#x200B;

Let's say you have developed symptoms and you to your doctor's office to gets a nasal swab test:

* **If you test positive for COVID-19**
   * Most people have mild COVID-19 illness and can recover at home without medical care. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have questions about your health.
* **If you test negative for COVID-19**
   * You are *probably* not infected *at the time your sample was collected.* It does not mean you will not get sick and you should still practice hygiene and social isolation
   * A negative test result only means that you did not have COVID-19 at the time of testing or that your sample was collected too early in your infection
   * You could also be exposed to COVID-19 after the test and then get infected and spread the virus to others.
   * If you have symptoms later, you may need another test to determine if you are infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.

\*\*\***Medical Testing for Diseases: The Basic Science**

This section may be too *sciency and jargonish,* and I placed it at the end for those who interested in false-negatives and false-positives. There's so muchplexity in evaluating a screening test, and I'll only the concepts.

&#x200B;

* · **Screening Tests –** Tests to assess the likely number/percentage of individuals in a defined population (e.g. a city, or a country) have. that particular disease. It is considered a *surveillance* test (which gives an overview of the situation), and generally **does not diagnose/confirm** the illness. Screening tests help policymakers to understand what is going on, where, and to decide what to do about it.
* · **Diagnostic Tests –** These are tests that alone, or inbination with another test, gives us an accurate enough result to diagnose/confirm the illness in an individual person. An individual with a positive diagnostic test tells a physician the individual ***most likely\*\*\**** has the illness. The emphasis is on “***most likely,****”* which I’ll further explain later.
* · **Sensitivity –** This refers to the percentage of positive results a test returns when that test is only given to patients with the disease, i.e. how many times the test **correctly identifies the person as positive**
   * In other words: “If I give this test to 1,000 confirmed covid cases, how many would the test **correctly identify with a positive result**, and how many confirmed covid cases would have a **false-negative result.**
* · **Specificity –** In contrast to Sensitivity, Specificity is the percentage of patients **without** the disease that a test correctly identifies with a negative result
   * “If I give this test to 1,000 healthy patients who do NOT have covid, how many would the test result **correctly show negative**, and how many would be a **false-positive result** and diagnose a healthy patient incorrectly with covid.”
* **Positive Predictive Value (PPV) -** Likelihood that a person receiving a positive screening test truly has COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID influences PPV, and therefore the percentage of false-positives
* **Negative Predictive Value (NPV) -** Likelihood that a person receiving a negative test result truly does not have COVID-19. Prevalence of COVID also impacts NPV, and subsequently percentage of false-negatives.

&#x200B;

Local Pharmacy's and Clinicsmonly use the [Abbott Diagnostics COVID-19 Antigen Test]( or [Quidel Sofia SARS Antigen FIA Test](

This two are Nasal Swab test that patients can do either at the clinic or at home. Depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the population, the Abbott Test has a PPV that ranges from 85%-99.9% and NPV of 92%-100%. Quidel Test is similar and has a PPV from 88.3%-100%, and a NPV 96.9%-99. 9%.

651,"So sad for my kids...Navigating raising kids and Covid Our middle and elementary school kids have friends, but these kids and their parents are not distancing or wearing masks regularly. Today (Halloween) my middle schooler missed out on a fun gathering at their best friend's house with all their close friends because we deemed the gathering unsafe.

In general, their friends are going to lessons, in stores not because they have to be supervised, but because they want to get out of the house, and at each others' houses for playdates (not podded up, just hanging out).

Those families will \*probably\* be fine Covid-wise. And if not, they have the money, relatives, and insurance to take care of themselves if not, unlike us.

Their kids are having fun. Mine are left out because we're being cautious and following the rules. That's my choice but it stinks.

I'd love for them to just make new friends, but it's so hard to make new friends during a pandemic when we're virtual-schooling. There's no social time at school, etc.

653,"Is this Depression or just COVID? 

A little info about me... I am 20 years old living on campus in college at the moment. I go to the gym five days a week and eat healthy.

During summer, I was an intern for apany, enjoyed doing hobbies like music, DJ'ing, and playing video games. Around the time when summer vacation ended and I started to return to college, I noticed that the hobbies I used to enjoy weren't satisfying anymore. I constantly feel bored in my dorm room (it is a single) and get irritated easily. I also feel drowsy earlier and more frequent. Overall, I've noticed a lack of interest in doing this.

This semester at school is also very different. Students aren't allowed to eat in the dining halls, you must wear a mask everywhere you go, many clubs and activities have been canceled. I am sure this also had an effect on me. There are times where I would just sit in my room and doze off on my phone or scrolling through social media because I don't feel like doing anything else. I have never been like this in the past.

Does this sound like depression to you? Or is it just COVID messing with college and taking away the fun experience that college should be? I have even thought just VERY slightly, what it would be like to just die, but currently I know I would rather live, so that is a good sign. I read that depression may not necessarily go away on its own and can actually worsen over time. I just do not want this to be the case.

660,"I have not stepped outside my house since March. I feel like a freak staying locked up like this; I hardly leave my own room, except to grab something to eat or to go to the bathroom, and I barely go to my own backyard. I feel like a weirdo especially when it seems like everyone in my city has given up and is not taking the pandemic seriously anymore. Even those people who are taking proper precautions are at least leaving their homes once in a while, if not everyday for work.

Why haven't I left? Well tbh it's really no one's fault but mine. Technically, no one is keeping me here chained. But in short, I have two relatives who are 65+ years old with many underlying health conditions. We don't want to get them sick with COVID, so we have decided to quarantine as much as possible.

This has been incredibly hard for me. I was already depressed due to loneliness before the pandemic began, and it's only made it worse. Things wouldn't be so bad if I could just go for a walk every once in a while and/or have therapy. But being locked up here with my family has made it almost impossible. I understand that they're scared about getting sick. But it's not like I'm asking to go out to a crowded party or other irresponsible activities. I just wanna walk with our dog in peace. I finally had a talk with one of the 65+ relatives about going for a walk. It seems like I'm closer to convincing them that it's okay to go for walks and we won't get sick from COVID-19. However, therapy is hard for me to get here. Since I'm low-ie my options are limited, and I can't seek in person therapy cause of quarantine.

Even if they were, I'm ufortable saying my deepest secrets in our small home where everyone can hear through these walls.

661,"New job, butpletely dreading it. Hate the way we're all backed into a corner. I have been unemployed since March when I was laid off. I have applied to SO MANY jobs. I finally was offered a job and to be honest, I am not looking forward to it at all. I don't trust public transit anymore so it's a 30/35 minute walk from me (owning a car would cost me 500-700 a month when all said and done - ridiculous). The work itself is drudgery. Thepany got terrible reviews on every job search site, saying everyone is made to work overtime and the managers are ipetent and have poor people skills. On the interview, I was informed people tend to work 6 hours on Saturdays. What?? I am thinking I might just ""not to be available"" on Saturdays until they fire me. It doesn't even make sense for my position to have to work overtime because it is so piecemeal. The only positive is that it pays well, but I do not want to sacrifice literally all my time for this asspany. I am studying for a class and a professional school entrance exam (job is not part of my career path) and I don't really have time to work on a Saturday even if I wanted to. They even asked if I couldplete one of the trainings before my start date.

I am quite certain there will be no respect for my life outside of work at this point. This sounds whiny but I have never been in a position where I had to take a job with ridiculous work-life balance, but the economy is such shit right now I don't feel I have a choice. The job is at apany and I am used to working in university/non-profit and I hate the whole idea. Capitalism fucking sucks. I am also afraid of catching COVID. This position was advertised as ""work from home"" but when they contact me for the interview, they inform me that is no longer the case. They ""appear"" to be taking it seriously, but then why are unnecessary people in the office? When I went in today for pre-employment stuff, the woman who is the receptionist wasn't wearing her mask until I walked up. Do they think the virus hides until people appear?? Is their ventilation system from a future where ductwork vaporizes the particles?? 

I have a job interview next week that pays barely minimum wage but does not have any of that working weekends nonsense and is more related to my career path and is remote. I have a credit card I would like to pay off though so the cash would be really nice. The job I accepted is only a temp position, for a handful of months, and then maybe they'd hire you if they still need you to do what it is you're doing or maybe a different position bes available. I asked about the benefits for permanent positions (temps have none) and their health plan is shitty and I kinda need that to be healthy. The amount of days off for permanent employees is laughable too.

I feel a deep sense of dread about this position. It is actually doing nothing but the job function I hated most in my previous position, but over and over again for 40+ hours each week. I was pressured to do unethical things related to this job function in a previous position (which I was able to dodge, thankfully) and I am wary of history repeating itself. In a normal economy, I would have closed the little box on indeed and moved on, but I was in desperation and things were looking bleak.

I was offered a contact tracer position in my city earlier this summer, and assumed it was located at the health dept (location wasn't advertised), but instead it was in no-man's land and hard to get to even on transit. And they were having hundreds of people work in person together. For a job that is done on the phone. And when the health department had a case among one of the employees, they managed it so poorly - didn't even tell employees to quarantine at first, didn't even CONTACT TRACE their own employees. So I wrote that off.

This whole thing just fucking sucks. Like a lot of y'all, COVID took away everything I loved about life - seeing friends, meeting new people, going out to restaurants and museums.

I'm asking because well, I've got to travel very soon, probably will have to stay in a hotel or something and I want to take the best precautions I can. Social distancing and wearing masks is all Ican think of doing. But I'm not sure if wearing just a flimsy surgical mask is gonna do the best job. 

Also, any suggestions on how to stay in a hotel during these times?(I'd avoid it I f I could so please don't say don't go to one in the first place!)
I've also been thinking of wearing gloves as well. Do you suggest them?

664,"Should we still be social distancing? Hi everyone,

Basically since COVID hit in March, I moved back home to be with my family and siblings, and I mostly spent time with family. Our family is pretty close so social distancing was relatively easy, and whenever I did spend time with friends/neighbors, we would go on walks/grab takeout with at least 6 ft of distance always. I'm going back to the city where I normally live in a few weeks, and I know my friends have been having regular maskless gatherings with <6 ft distance at restaurants and at people's houses. I'm aware that some restaurants have been open for outdoor and indoor dining for a while now, but I'm wondering how safe these gatherings might be and whether people should still try to quarantine/social distance as much as possible. I guess I'm just not 100% sure what the risk is, and I know it's going to be tough turning down the opportunity to see people in person, since it's been a long time/I obviously miss them/don't want to seem like I'm judging them or am being a buzzkill. I've been seeing mixed information on what kind of gatherings/behaviors are okay/safe, and wanted to reach out to thismunity too to get some advice.

Thanks!

**Tldr:** I've been conflicted since many of my friends have seemed to have gone back to their normal lives, but I've still been pretty cautious and am not sure if get-togethers might be okay or if it's better to avoid. In the case of avoiding, do you have tips on how to turn people down without sounding like a ""buzzkill"" or overly cautious?",6,0.81,jl83x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jl83x8/should_we_still_be_social_distancing/,13,Questions,2020-10-31,3,85,0.03529411764705882
665,"COVID is taking out my entire family Hey all. I’m a little stressed/depressed/burnt out atm. I’m here, in Canada. We (my parents, brother, and I) immigrated 23 years ago (when I was a little one) from South Africa where the majority of my family still resides. About two weeks ago, we found out about the first confirmed case within my family over there. Before that was confirmed, my aunts/uncles/cousins were helping out my my grandparents with groceries and around-the-house chores as they are 85+. As of last week, we’ve had 5+ confirmed cases within my SA family including both my high-risk grandparents. 

Unfortunately yesterday, my grandfather (86) passed away due to the virus, the lack of beds and his old age didn’t grant him as a “priority”. My uncle (66) has been in an induceda for over a week - he doesn’t even know that his father died - and today we found out that my aunt (62) has been admitted to ICU. We’re extremely worried about my grandmother as they celebrated their 65th wedding anniversary this year - she doesn’t know any way of life besides the one she shares with my grandfather, and now the rest of the family is too sick to take care of her.

I just feel like this virus is taking out my whole family, and there’s nothing we can do on this side of the world. Not sure what I’m looking for to be honest, I’m just stuck.

Edit: thank you to everyone for their love and support. I know there’s not much to say in these circumstances, it’s just nice to be in a place where I don’t feel guilty for being upset. Me being very young when we moved to Canada, and only having the opportunity to meet my family a handful of times - I feel like I don’t have the right to be as upset as other people in my family.

I'm very confused about this. When this all started, expert all said that the spikes were to last 2/3 months, and that actually happened. But then again, the USA only had a big huge wave and even other countried didn't really get much better since this started.

Some believe this wave will peak in December, some in January and some say we will need to wait until May, but that's a really horrible prospect.

So, I'm a 25yr old male living in Brazil (aka the covid paradise shithole where our assface president is refusing to even buy the Coronavac because it's chinese) and the first 4 months of quarantine were OK to me, because I was always the kind of guy who prefers to stay home and play video games and all. During these first 4 months, I was working from home and devouring through my PS4 backlog, while getting really stresses from work (I work in export, absolute chaos even in big multinationalpanies since the dollar has basically be gold and everybody wants a piece). 
To make matters worse, I was forced to return to the office in late July and had a doctor's note rmending that I work from home due to being obese (around 5'9 and 220lbs, but everything absolutely fine: vitamin D ok, no diabetes, cholesterol good...) refused by mypany due to obesity alone not being considered a risk group for covid-19.

- As of today, I've been through way worse in the job, maybe it wouldn't be fair to past me to quit now. Like, if I get the vaccine in Q1 2021, I would end up regretting quitting my job.
- Even if I start to feel better after quitting, I could end up bagging another element fornmy anxiety: economic uncertainty, even if I managed to save a lot of money (like enough to keep me 2-3 yrs without working). Along with this, I worry about my parents making my life a living hell if I'm unemployed while still living with them, just until I get my head straight and this pandemic ends. Hell, I'm even considering working at hostels around the country in exchange for housing and food just to keep away from them.

It has been really hard for me to stay focused on the present and the future (there's nothing much to look forward to or be excited about). I constantly have urges to ask people for reassurance, constantly worry, and I've been feeling anxious as well. And I feel tired often.

I don't think my mental health had ever gone this bad before, and I feel bit miserable. I sometimes feel like a failure, I don't deserve what I have, and I just don't feel good about myself. I also don't feel motivated... I'm just not happy.

I would also like to say that I just feel different as a person. I feel like I've became more introverted and bit weaker (for example, I eat less nowadays inparison to the past years and don't really get hungry all that often nor feel like I should eat).

These increases likely stem from the changes to daily life we have all been asked to make in attempts to mitigate viral spread.

Supported by funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the University of Regina, a longitudinal population-based survey was conducted using a large sample of Canadian and American respondents, with surveys administered in late March, mid-May and early July of 2020. Based on this data they determined that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is best understood as a multi-faceted syndromeprising a network of interconnected symptoms.

Using data from approximately 7,000 respondents collected in late March, the team developed, validated, and published a [COVID Stress Scales](

689,"“It won’t last forever” doesn’t help me at all. It doesn’t matter if this doesn’t last forever. Many things have been irreparably changed by this. (Goodbye, movie theaters. I miss you.) I will not be happy until I can walk into a grocery store mask free. I will not be happy until I can go to a concert and enjoy it packed with the crowd. I will not be happy until I can book a vacation to see the world. WHY can’t people understand that for some of us, this WILL be perpetual depression until things are normal? That going for a walk isn’t going to change that?

I’d be so interested to hear from a therapist how much this has all shredded my mental health and how many issues I’ve accumulated, but I can’t do that. 

I wear the masks. I distance. I stayed home for
months. I don’t go party. WHY does it feel like IM the one getting punished??????

691,"Dealing with pandemic fatigue, and Reddit isn't helping Like most Americans, I'm definitely feeling the ""pandemic fatigue."" Don't get me wrong. I'll wear a mask, wash my hands, and take all necessary precautions. But I can't live in a bubble forever. I need to socialize, see friends, go to church, and do the many things that were taken away from me for months without warning. Unfortunately, it seems most people on this site don't agree. 

There's a classic saying when ites to journalism: ""If it bleeds, it leads."" r/coronavirus is no exception. Posts that talk about good progress and high hopes are lucky to get a few hundred upvotes. Whereas any post along the lines of ""America bad, hospitals overwhelmed, your neighbors want to kill you, etc."" get thousands of upvotes and awards. 

I understand the need to be informed, and I also understand that many of the Mods here also mod r/coronavirus. Please don't take this the wrong way. But it's hard to maintain a positive attitude when all you see in your feed is arguments and hatred. 

I want to be able to hug my friends without some random redditor calling me a murderer. I want to be able to go into a friend's house without some Twitter activist calling me selfish. I want small businesses to operate and make enough money to keep the lights on without woke instagram influencers yelling ""profits over people!"" 

I'm not denying that this virus is dangerous. Heck, I'll wear a mask while I sleep if it means we can beat this. But I'm so sick and tired of people fighting, claiming the moral high ground, and calling anybody who dares to visit the friends they haven't seen since March a murderer. 

""I haven't left the house since March"" isn't something to brag about. It's a travesty. I don't understand why it has to be an ""either, or"" scenario. Do I really have to choose between the pandemic and living my life? 

Anyways, those are my thoughts. I might get a bunch ofments saying I'm a selfish narcissist who only cares about himself, but I just want to be honest.

692,"Roommates not respecting health regulations — what do I do? Hi all,

I currently live in Montreal where, if you haven’t heard, Covid cases are the worst in Canada. We have restrictions in place right now that specify [no visitors from other households]( among other things. I am an anglophone living in a flat with three francophones who are very close friends. A few times now they have gone against the government's mandate and had one friend from another household over; I am pretty sure they know this is against the current restrictions.

I sent a message to our groupchat outlining that I’m ufortable with it, and politely asking to stop having visitors. It sounds weird to type out like this because I am keenly aware that this pandemic is not anywhere near over, and I know that they don't care as much as I do. One of my roommates doesn't wash her hands after using the washroom! 

Technically the violation of the restrictions could be a $1000 fine each, but I don't think it will evere to that seeing as it's just one person visiting. We're a house of students and I get that they are craving new connection, and that a lot ofpromise is required as this house doesn’t belong to any of us, we just need a place to stay. They are especially exhausted with Zoom classes and exams and with living a country they aren't native to (they are from France). But COME ON, EVERYONE is sacrificing right now and you have to have someone over twice?? Maybe I'm just looking for some reassurance here so I don't feel crazy.

693,"Am I wrong to be worried about masks and social distancing being required way after a vaccine? Don't get me wrong. Happy to do my part to slow the spread now.

But as weeks turn into months, I get antsy. Depressed. Worried there won't be much toe back to when everything goes back to normal.

And with promising vaccines on the horizon for early next year, I'm feeling optimistic about being vaccinated sometime between April/June of 2021.

But then now Fauci is saying at least 2022 for back to normal, when he said 2021 last week.

Then it'll be ""*the vaccine isn't 90 percent effective...you'll still need to distance and mask*""

And then a year goes by and the same shit happens.

They estimate it'll be 60-70 percent effective or so. And as a result, dramatically reduce hospitalizations and deaths.

We can't get it down to zero. Even with the flu vaccine, we can't.

But I am very concerned about moving goalposts.

I think once I get the vaccine, I'll stop being super worried when I go out, but I'll mask and distance for a few months while people get vaccinated.

But there will be a critical mass and I think it'll be before Fauci's prediction.

And even with that...no idea if they'll just keep moving those goalposts.

*Do you think there's a chance we can have a family Christmas party, Thanksgiving gettogether, and live normal life before the holiday season of 2021*?

694,"Finding Home 

I'm hear to help cope, share my story, and hopefully provide myself with some form of personal release.

2020 has been a hard year for me.

I'm 29, I have PTSD and general anxiety disorder, being along and away from people is hard for me.

In November 2019, I quite my corporate Job right before the pandemic hit and decided to move across the country to help my father along with my girlfriend. Ohio to Texas. I sold my house, packed up my belongings and moved in order to help my recently retired father with a new business. I took the opportunity as a chance to better my relationship with him and bond more with my family. Two weeks in Texas, my girlfriend and I was kicked out of the house after finding out my father had a bad drug habit, (cocaine, meth, weed and drinking all day every day). Along with being kicked out, I was fired as well from working for him. This happened at the end of February right when Covid lockdowns started.

I packed up what I could, I took the cars, the dogs and my girlfriend to the nearest city Austin. I took a big financial risk moving to Texas and it didn't pan out. My father left me with the bill for numerous things despite agreeing to pay them, which is one of the only conditions as to why I moved in the first place. It amounted to 10's of thousands of dollars.

I was still in school online finishing my masters in business analytics and continued to fight through to finish the degree as I was in my last semester in spring 2020. While we where in the motel 6 studio hotel room, I started applying to anything I could. Eventually I scraped the last bit of money I had left and was able to secure an apartment in Austin. The money was running out andpanies where pausing hiring. I worked nights at HEB stocking groceries to get through and to get some moneying in, but it wasn't enough. They where one of the few places open and hiring still. Months have past and I finally started a great corporate job in May. I went 7 months, 7 fucking months, without a good job. I lost mostly everything I had worked for. I moved to Tampa in order to work at that location, Tampa was expensive and wasn't the best place to live, I didn't know anyone there. After 4-5 months I moved from Tampa to San Antonio. My girlfriend stayed in Austin, Texas while I was in Tampa, she was lucky to get a job at a food establishment and worked to work as there where not a lot of opportunities. Now that I am back in Texas, all I can think about is moving back to Columbus, OH where I have lived for almost the last decade. I went to school there twice and started my career there, it feels like home. My father still has an addiction problem, my mother and I are going to try and get him some help, but he doesn't think he has a problem. The only benefit of being in San Antonio is my parents live close in Austin and my cousin lives in Houston, with another in San Antonio along with my aunt. My brother is back in Columbus, OH.

I honestly don't know what to do, this job pays more than I was making before and I am still recovering financially, but these next two months I should be good again, but Iming to the realization that money cant buy you happiness. I signed a 3 month lease here in San Antonio, hopefully by then I will able to decide. I have already applied back at the oldpany I worked for in Ohio and have already received some responses.

Working from home is lonely, I've moved 4 times so far just this year, 3 of those cross country. I miss my friends in Ohio, I miss going into the office. It is a miracle that I still wake up every morning. I am grateful to have a job, and to be able to recover, to finish my degree all in the wake of a global pandemic we haven't seen since 100 years ago. I'm just trying to find home.

700,"I just lost my job. It is partly my own fault, given the circumstances, but Covid definitely made it worse.  See, I worked with children in an afterschool program, which is normally fine, but obviously it's near-impossible to get young children to follow proper social-distancing rules (they were in the kindergarten to third-grade range, so you can imagine how that went).  Plus, at first, my supervisors allowed the kids to take their masks off in the (small, ill-ventilated) classroom for long periods and to have them off indefinitely while outside on the playground or even in the gym.  That policy later changed, but it was the rule until very recently.

Due to my increasing fear of getting the disease, coupled with my generally poor immune system due to my cerebral palsy and other factors (I was sick nearly every other week last school year while working, and that was just with normal colds and stomach bugs I picked up from the kids), I began to have things slip through the cracks and made some pretty serious mistakes involving the safety of the kids, which I don't think I would have done normally if I wasn't constantly preoccupied and distracted about catching the virus from the kids or a coworker.

Needless to say, they called me in on Monday before my scheduled shift and simply handed me a separation document to sign, severing my employment with thepany, and that was it.  I wasn't given the opportunity to explain why this stuff was happening (and, granted, they *had* given me a few verbal and one written warnings), and I was simply told to leave and that I was ineligible to be rehired.

So, that's that and I don't exactly have much recourse to get my job back.  I do, thankfully, have a pretty solid savings account from years past, which remained mostly intact during the quarantine, so I'm not currently at risk of starving or being out on the street, but I just can't go back to work right now.  I have a job team that works with me, due to my disability, and they asked if I wanted to look for another job right now...and I honestly told them that, no, I don't want to during the pandemic.  It would likely just happen again.

Am I just being selfish?  I know that millions of people simple *can't* find any work at all, even if they want to, and *I'm* choosing not to look for anything else right during the current crisis (which only seems to be spiraling more and more out of control over the past few months).  My team has told me it's fine, and have backed me up in my view that I probably shouldn't look for anything else due to my (pretty well-justified) fears of catching the virus, which would be the same at any job, let alone one involving children!

I was torn away from college early in May and never got a proper goodbye to the few friends I had, who live thousands of miles away. I lost my last chance at success in my beloved college sport, when I had -finally- qualified for the finals of my event after four years of trying to. I graduated over a YouTube video where they didn't even say our names.

Now I am at home working my first real job, and it is a remote work-from-home job. I already hate it. I feel expendable and fear being fired every minute. I feel so lost and don't know anyone's faces, only voices from 10 minute Skype calls. I am living with my parents and my 'office' is my spare bedroom where I have to just lock myself in for the duration of the day, and then when I'm done, I just go to my regular bedroom, because what else is there to do?

I will never meet my coworkers face to face. I do not have a single friend in this town. Not one.  All I have is my parents and my pets and no means to meet anyone else even if I wanted. Online apps don't work for me. Even my friends from school are drifting away from texting me at all. If I tried to move out, I would be more depressed because then I would be REALLY alone. I never got to date, I never got to 'party' in my school. None of it.

About halfway through the shopping trip, I started to look around at the nearby people and see some werent wearing a mask/werent wearing one properly. I went into a full blown panic attack and had to immediately hurry out, leaving my grandparents in the store.

When they came out, Instead of being understanding, my grandparents were angry and embarrassed of me. My grandfather told me to ""rank about this kind of crap"" to my counselor, because it's ""not normal"". That really hurt my feelings, and I was sad and hurt and angry for the rest of the day.

Aside from that, I cant figure out what to do regarding spending time with my friends. I love all of my friends, and theyre the only true support group I have (family is all mega conservative, homophobic, etc.) But I feel like im putting myself at risk by going to spend time with them.

Like, I have a coworker who im friends with. I see him touch his eyes, his nose, take his mask off while we're at work. His mask has gaps and would certainly allow viral particles in. He always downplays the severity of the virus and gets into arguments with me when I talk about new studies because I'm 'spreading misinformation'. He lives with his boyfriend and best friend, who im sort of romantically involved with.

Another friend I spend time with rarely leaves the house, as he's unemployed. Some of the only times he does go out is to spend time with other friends. There's no social distancing in the car. I've seen him eat without cleaning his hands. One of our mutual friends he spends time with works in an assisted living facility. Aside from that, though, he's usually fairly cautious.

I dont know if i should cut my friends out right now, or if I can continue to spend time with them while wearing a mask/eye protection. I still go work in public, but im taking every possible measure to ensure my safety there.

707,"suicidal thoughts relapse vol. 2: now with seasonal depression! firstly, thanks to all who supported me in thements under my previous post related to suicide! i didn't answer everyone bc i had some real-life problems to solve but i still deeply appreciate all your effort, many thanks for caring!  


after the previous post, i kind of gave myself some time, found a really good psychotherapist, started actively looking for a job... until today.  
to be clear, i live in siberia (and we have shitty winters) and i've been inclined to seasonal affective disorder since i was 19 or 20, that's not the first time of me slipping into the downward spiral with the first snow. however, now it's way worse. i looked up the weather forecast for a month, i saw that yesterday was the last warm day for five goddamn months (or six in case of bad luck), i saw a heavy snowfall outside, and i had a severe mental breakdown that lasted two hours just because I DON'T WANT WINTER. another thing why i was crying and screaming all morning was incredibly stupid: the virus robbed me of halloween, my favorite holiday (yep, some people, mostly young, celebrate it in russia and usually my town had a bunch of theme parties, some of them even didn't suck). now the healthcare system in my town ispletely collapsed, the numbers grow higher each day, and all the events are canceled and i'm pissed. it's a minor inconvenience but it was one of the many last drops because one of not so many things that kept me from suicide in spring was that ""maybe things will get better by halloween and i'll make a cool costume and play a dj set at a theme party"". spoiler alert: they didn't.  


another thing that happened today was that my friend/ex-lover who is currently in moscow said that he was fired from his job at the university (he's a scientist, currently doing neurobiology or something) because no one has money because of the you-know-what-virus. i'm unemployed right now too, and i've been looking for a job since early october. what he wrote caused a full-blown panic attack and a self-harm relapse which hadn't happened for months due to prescription drugs i've been taking all this  time. i'm angry because my life is ruined, the lives of everyone i love and care about are ruined, i started having massacre fantasies again (about murdering everyone who is responsible for the pandemic or generally killing random people in the streets because YOU RUINED EVERYTHING NOW GET THIS), i started to feel the desire of breaking things and self-mutilation again, and, even worse – my suicidal thoughts came back and hoo boy they are intense. i even sort of feel like everything in the world tells me: *kill yourself, kill yourself, kill yourself.* i survived psychosis in spring and i feel like this mental state ising back again and it's gonna be even worse because it's heavily affected by the nasty weather with snow, cold temperatures, and getting dark at 6 pm. these thoughts are so persistent that i feel like i have a cuckoo clock in my head. probably there are no choices left for me anymore. it's not that i really want to kill myself (although i want to fall asleep forever), it's more like i *have* to kill myself because there's no future, everything is gonna get worse and worse, i'll never get a job, and the only thing to look forward to is five to six months of cold darkness and snow. i won't survive this winter at any possible scenario.",7,1,jjmuia,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jjmuia/suicidal_thoughts_relapse_vol_2_now_with_seasonal/,5,Trigger Warning,2020-10-29,-33,207,-0.15942028985507245

Im 49, and while im healthy, illnesses like colds, viruses hit me harder but overall im really not that afraid ill die from it. Same with my husband. However our 11 year old is at a higher risk due to reactive airway disease. I never want to see him near death in a hospital like he was at 6 weeks from rsv. So hes doing remote schooling, even though hes only one of three kids. Hes not happy and quite honestly, i dont think hes learning a damn thing. But i think its because the way the teachers have to teach and handle in person and remote. I really feel for them. Hes done with school by 12:45!!! And zero homework.

For my job, ive been wfh for two years. I realized that mentally, i must work from home. I have severe depression and anxiety. While treated, wfh staves off feeling trapped in an office, feeling forced to be difficult because of office politics that im just not getting by working from home, and just nixingmute stress. Three years ago, i had a breakdown because of my last job. I just cant ever go back to an office again. But ourpany is doing big layoffs every three mo. My project manager bitched to my boss that im too slowpared to a coworker. My cool boss said while slow is interpretation, he needs a reason to fight for my value. He mentioned that i might have to transition as a writer. While i have extensive experience in it, i hate it. But i need to work. My husband’s job is in danger os surviving due to covid. His financial savvy and budgeting is always a mess, which pulls me down. During round one of lockdown, i took advantage of the cares act with my 401k, depleting $40k from it and probably wont be able to pay it back. My work insurance premiums doubled to $800 a mo. I need to save and reduce debt, AND restart my 401k that i haven’t contributed to for a year and a half due to him being out of work and covering bills. 

Im struggling with my meds and anxiety. Im struggling with my marriage.  Im struggling to deal with now tween attitude son. Im struggling making sure he is learning because hes not a great student. .im struggling with my husband’s “i will not work for someone else” spoiled attitude when we need money. Im struggling with turning 50 and we have shit for retirement BECAUSE of my husband. Im struggling with the thought of not only losing my job, insurance, but knowing any job will make me go into an office. 

I have so many doubts if im making the right safety choices in protecting myself, my son yet husband must be social so it feels like hes killing my efforts. I feel trApped in non stop struggle and doubt. Is this what my life and future is going to be like forever???? How can i effectively treat my severe depression and anxiety with all of this bullshit.

715,"I did (almost) everything to isolate and still got Covid. A story I shared on Facebook. I shared this on Facebook today (my country had 10.000 new positive tests today). I figured I could share it hear and maybe have some support from you guys. I hope I don't scare you too much.

---

I am one of today's 10.000

For those who say 'scared and vulnerable people should just isolate themselves'; I tried. I haven't hugged a friend since march, I have barely seen friends at all. The past weeks, with the rising infections in my area, I've only seen my (mental) health workers, and my dad (to help me around the house and keep mepany) who most of the time wore a (FFP1) mask. My housemate and I were never in the same room, kept as much distance as we could and ventilated the house constantly. Groceries got delivered. I still got it, and I have no clue how. I gave so much to avoid this.

For now I seem good, my airway symptoms are barely more than my regular airway symptoms (which made me highly surprised that I got a positive; be aware that you can have it without noticing!). Let's hope it stays that way because I don't know if I have what it takes to do anóther recovery program while I am not even recovered from my cancer treatments three years ago.

But I want to say to everyone who says scared people should isolate: I did, and I still got it.

 The only way we can keep this away from people (much) more vulnerable than me, is to work together, to limit our contacts, instead of looking for the gaps in the law or just plainly ignoring it to do what we want.

I know, it's hard. I feel it. My depression and anxiety already got worse over isolating (at points close to having a crisis) but that was my choice not to get more lingering health issues and chronic fatigue than I already have due to my cancer treatments. I still got it and feel I might as well just have hugged everyone the past 8 months, and dance, and do everything that made me happy since apparently it wouldn't have made a difference. I get it is hard, especially when it takes so long. But we can only do this together, even if it takes longer than we like.

Let's all work together. We can do this. Together we can keep others safe.

P.S. I have moments I'm pretty scared so although thoughts and prayers (and other spiritual acts) usually don't help fixing crises, I would appreciate them at this moment :)

716,"Why do some families act as though covid will never penetrate their family bonds? Why do others keep a safe distance? Hey guys! Really trying to understand something and after a read, this seems like a good group to ask. I thought maybe you could point me towards articles or studies that will help me understand a question.

Some families I know act as though the “family” designation makes Covid guidelines irrelevant, even when the family members are mixed ages, live in separate households and some of them have jobs/school that involve regular contact with others. Think adult siblings, their senior parents, kids, etc.

Other families I know see each other only in front yards, etc.

I’m looking for some scholarship or journalism that digs into this. There must be norms and belief structures that feed into it. Is it religion, cultural tradition, family power dynamics, pervasive lack of boundaries, what?  What characteristics define each type of family aside from covid behavior? No way it’s random, and no way the families who don’t distance just “love each other more.”

If any of you have read anything relevant or have expertise or experience related to this question, please share!  Its not for a paper or anything, I’m just trying to understand some of the people around me/close to me.

His parents offered us their basement, which is decked out and they used it for AirBnB. Since they haven't been able to rent it out during lockdown, we figure we can save on rent and spend time with them.

We've gotten rid of our things (storage/trash/sold via shipping) and have everything ready to be packed into our car to drive over from Washington to Colorado in one go. The plan is to leave Friday evening and get there Saturday night, taking turns driving. 

We've been really good about social distancing, staying home, wearing masks when we need to, and getting groceries and other necessities delivered. We're not high risk. We were under the impression that in laws were also taking this situation seriously, especially because my FIL is diabetic and is high risk.

I've been terrified, obviously. I asked her not to hang out with my best friend, because my doctor directly told me it wasn't safe, not even to hang out with her outdoors. She brushed it off as must my OCD and refused to listen. So now I'm going to be strung out.  


But today, my best friend just said her positive contact (who never had symptoms) got another test (I think a rapid test, but not sure) and came back negative.   


So I'm curious now if it was a false positive? But almost everything I can find seems to say that that's almost impossible? And I'm guessing the second test could be wrong since false negatives are possible?  


I just can't tell how worried to be. I had been off pretty much all of last week a bit - just likely allergies and the weather (I always get a little stuffy/clogged ears etc this time of year and with the weather we've been having), and now today my throat is scratchy when I swallow (but my sinuses are really dried out and my ears are clogged, and I've not been drinking well due to anxiety, so I'm guessing again it's still weather and not drinking). Note: I'm getting tested this weekend regardless because I have to go to my doctor anyway.  


Gah. I literally have Alexa alerts set up for 5 days from each exposure and 14 days from each exposure, so I can know when to chill a bit about any potential symptoms. And I'm trying not to obsess. But I'm obviously not doing great at it. Thinking I only had to worry about the timeline from my roommate's initial exposure would make me a lot calmer (already almost at the five-day point there, which is where I usually start calming down a bit), but I'm also almost more worried cuz I'm afraid they're just going to go around spreading it now after getting false negatives.

I have not onceplained about wearing a mask, and I have done my best to stay at home unless it's for the essentials. When i do see friends, it's always distanced and with a mask. All in all, I feel like I have done my part to keep myself and others safe/healthy.

Meanwhile, there are ENOUGH moronic and/or inconsiderate shitheads out there that showing such recklessness and heartlessness with their bitching about masks, or going into overfilled bars. The god damn president himself is hosting super spreader events, and the US government seems to give such few shits about giving any kind of relief to their own people. It is exhausting. I really don't feel much of anything when I see headlines or statistics anymore. 

I would hope that the amount ofpassionate people outweigh the heartless ones, but it feels like that point doesn't really matter. There are ENOUGH of these regressives out there that my precautionary efforts feel useless. If even just a few more gave a shit about this pandemic, maybe there'd be some sense of hope on the horizon 8 months later.

One of the dudes at the hangout tested positive for covid and just got put in the hospital this morning- the cousin was how my boyfriend found out. I hung out with my boyfriend the rest of the day (after he hung out with the positive friend) on Saturday, spent the night at his house and spent most of Sunday with him- kissing him and etc. My living situation is that I live with three other people, which I could definitely spread the disease to if I already have it. I could stay at my boyfriends house (with his cousin) until they get their negative results back or finish their quarantine (if they tested positive). I got tested but it’s gonna take 3 days for all of our results toe in 

Now I’m debating if I should stay at my boyfriends house.  

If I stay at my place, I could either already have the virus in me and spread it to my roommates. If I don’t have the virus and I stay with my boyfriend and his cousin then I’ll just unnecessarily get sick.

730,"the spectre of long covid and my inability to ""learn to live with this"" hello all,

i'm writing to you today because i read yet another twitter thread of an under-45 detailing how they've be basically disabled after a covid infection. in the months since the pandemic began, many thousands of people all over the world havee forward with similar stories and health experts have yet to pinpoint exactly why they are experiencing this. some say it has to do with post-viral infection, others say its the immune system responding adversely, among other things. the exact number of people who have had to deal with this ""long covid"" is also uncertain, since it is mostly based on how many people have signed up for internet support groups.  however likely it is that a person will experience long covid or why exactly it happens is of little consequence to this post, however, because the threat of long covid has been haunting me since i first heard of it.

i am a 19-year-old college student, and i have no pre-existing conditions. on paper, i am of the class of people who don't need to take any extenuating precautions in order to prevent covid infection, but people not much older than me with the same health conditions have fallen victim to this. there might still merit in the idea that these cases are a very small minority, highlighted by an attentive newsmedia, and that i shouldn't worry about getting long covid anymore than i worry about being struck by lightning, but there are times where that sounds more like denial than it does reason.

does anyone else struggle with the same fear and uncertainty? does anyone have resources on the topic of long covid which could help explain the actual threat to poses to the average person?",3,0.67,jif5nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jif5nk/the_spectre_of_long_covid_and_my_inability_to/,6,Discussion,2020-10-27,-13,88,-0.14772727272727273

I work in Chicago, in a very large office building where most people, including myself, take public transportation to get to work.

However, mypany just announced they want office workers to return to the office in January, at least 2 days a week. No one I work with, including my immediate supervisor understand why we need to do this, especially since COVID cases have been rising in Illinois as many expected this fall/winter. Thepany email announcement just mentioned “collaboration” and “culture.” I have taken this pandemic extremely seriously since the beginning.

I have a lot of anxiety about the possibility of having to take public transportation and go into an office again in January with COVID still so prevalent. Even if I don’t die, there are still so many unknowns with this disease and the long term effects. I realize I am very lucky and privileged to have been able to work remotely thus far and have a job.

My father is down with Covid since last week and I'm panicking. I'm not here to bitch about my bad luck on the contrary I know for sure we have been fortunate as a family to not have any positive Covid cases until now. My girlfriend is a nurse and her father got infected back in the early days of the pandemic required intubation but managed to pull out of that with the help of some of the best doctors in town. I'm mexican and as many of you might know our public hospitals are having a terrible record at managing to do the same with their intubed patients. My father in law is lucky to work at Pemex, their hospitals are much better equipped and have many more resources than public ones. Which takes me to the next part in this rant.

I live in Tamaulipas. As of right now all my savings are gone and I maxed out 2 credit cards, have reached out to all of my family and friends. We are lucky enough to be able to afford an improvised ICU in my father's house with their help and my girlfriend is going to look over him to the best of her abilities. I am grateful for that. But if you got any advice on how to get cheaper blood sugar medications or any hustle you can send my way I'm down for it. If you want to see a chubby white guy self mutilate for you on camera I'm down for it too, right now I'm doing it just to cope with this nightmare.

735,"I feel like this year changed me I’ve been thinking about things a lot tonight. 
I miss who I was before all this crazy. I used to be such a positive and upbeat person. I’ve always had some struggle in my life going in an out hospitals with Cystic Fibrosis. Having surgeries and scary health moments. Even the worst thing losing my best friend in 2018 when she passed from CF. 
Even in that grief and other trials I always tried to find the good in the world. I held onto knowing life gets better.

This year it feels so different. My physical health is in a great spot. My mental health is not. I’ve never experienced anything like the anxious nights of no sleep. The very dark thoughts and moments where I just didn’t want to do it anymore. The feeling like a burden on everyone because I can’t keep it together (even though my friends and family always say it’s fine) the being happy for a few days/weeks but knowing I’m gonna fall again. The faking happy and deciding to act okay even when I don’t feel it. 

I do have my good days and weeks. I have had joy and laughter. But I miss that positive outlook. Some days I can no longer find it.

They did not find any evidence of her having the virus but I think the pandemic and the overall impact and the sense of isolation and loneliness of not being able to see me or others besides my aunt (who social distances every time theye to see her) just got to the point where she wanted to go.

The weather is supposed to be lovely and it might be nice to walk around the neighborhood and see costumes and decorations. No social interaction with strangers for me though.

That said, it’s going to be a family gathering... my parents (who are super cautious and wear masks everywhere) and my brother’s family. The latter are the risk factor.

I haven't hung out with anyone, been to any stores (literally), or really done anything since March. I trusted this family (my mistake) so I went inside. I wore a cloth mask the entire time. My neighbor answered the door (unmasked), but she stood back and I was still outside at this point. Her mom came by and brought me in - my neighbor then went immediately upstairs, and I went to the family room. I sat masked in the same room as her unmasked parents at a distance of 6-10 feet, probably closer to somewhere like 8-10 feet, if not more. I gave a side hug to her unmasked mom, and we stood facing the same way talking - not facing each other, but facing a painting - for a minute or two. Then when she wanted to show me pictures on her phone, she put on a loose-fitting mask, but she held it close to her cheeks with her fingers. My neighbor came downstairs, with a well-fitting mask on, to say hi. She did not talk too much of this time, and I left a minute or two after she came downstairs. She was, I think, 6 feet away from me (I was sitting on the couch, she was standing in the center of the room). I was there for only 30 minutes to an hour, with my mask on the whole time.

The only contact we had was right at the front door when she was unmasked and then at the very end when she was masked. Our contact was probably less than 2 minutesbined, definitely less than five. Her parents got tested yesterday. I'm hoping they're negative.

I'm just so worried. I've been in quarantine since I found out, but my parents are high-risk, and I don't want to infect them. I wear a mask when I leave my room, which isn't really at all unless to go to the bathroom. I'm beating myself up over going there. I wish I never did. :(

I think, based on the experience, that I'm not considered a close contact to my neighbor - but I would be to her mom, right? That's why I'm hoping she tests negative. If she tests negative, I will feel much morefortable and safe. I'll be going for a test on Monday or Tuesday. I would just like some reassurance. :( I'm not /too/ worried, but I am at the same time. I just hate all the anxiety. I have enough of it as it is (OCD/hypochondria) lol.

746,"Need some advice: Had symptoms, but received a negative result. Possibly a false negative? What do I do from here? 3 days ago, I found everything started to taste incredibly sour, without much other flavors. Coffee, & Peanut Butter smelled weirdly sour, and I normally have a horrible reaction to smelling things like vinegar. I could barely smell it, even when I put my nose up to the top of the bottle.

We have no concrete point where I might have been exposed.

Immediately I started self-isolating. That meant separating from my girlfriend and roommate. Not being able to cook my own food, etc.

I ordered an at-home test and the next day I sent my sample in.

Over the next two days, I stopped tasting most things, and the few things that I could taste generally tasted terrible. Bell peppers taste like rotting onions now and eggs seem to have no flavor at all, including the yolks. Coffee tasted a bit more sour and was at 25% of it's normal flavor and lackedplexity. Last night, I couldn't taste my toothpaste.

My most significant symptom was changes/loss of smell and taste. Intense, painful tension in my upper back, neck and shoulders was also a thing, slight pressure on my lungs at times.

My results came in this morning, and they came back negative.

Also, this morning, I had my morning coffee and found it tasted a little weak, but had theplexity back to it. Every ingredient of my standard morning breakfast tasted almost normal with the exception of bell peppers, which were \~50% of the flavor, but significantly sour.

Not sure if I should still bepletely isolating, including from my roommates.

Also not sure if maybe I took the test too early. From my understanding, if you have symptoms, you should have a significant enough viral load for a test.

Should I schedule a re-test?Should I stay isolated?Would it be OK to just social distance, and clean things up after using them instead of total isolation?",6,1,jhwts1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jhwts1/need_some_advice_had_symptoms_but_received_a/,4,Questions,2020-10-26,-20,131,-0.15267175572519084
747,"I'm Getting Sick of Waiting Alright, I've told this story a thousand times, and now a thousand and one. I was born in 1991 to poor Jewish parents. I was intellectually gifted, so I skipped second, third, fifth, and eleventh grade. This didn't mix well with my having Asperger's and apparently ""dull"" personality as a child. My parents were too poor to spend time with me, and when they were around they were distant and unloving. So, after I graduated college in 2010 with degrees in microeconomics, personal finance, and accounting, I got a job at a local financial firm.

By March 2011, I had saved up enough money to move out. The following month, I chose to recreate my lost childhood. Ever since, I've spent my freetime cuddling teddy bears, eating ""childish"" foods like chicken nuggets, apple juice, pop tarts, and cotton candy, watching cartoons like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and We Bare Bears, and jumping on hopper balls and in bouncy houses.

And I have a collection of friends with similar histories who engage in these activities with me. But ever since COVID-19 entered our state, we've been distancing. But god I miss spending time with them.

I miss doing their makeup and having them do mine. I miss having hopper ball races with me. I miss binging cotton candy with them and then jumping all the newfound energy out in my bouncy house. I miss snuggling with them on Friday evenings binging We Bare Bears.

748,"Maintenance ising tomorrow and I am panicking. So I live in Portland, ME in an apartment with an unfinished basement, a ground level, and an upstairs.  I noticed yesterday that there was a small spot of mold on my kitchen ceiling.  It was in the corner of the kitchen above the refrigerator, near the backdoor.  I have gone through this whole ordeal so far without having anybody in my wife and I's apartment.  

But due to possible water leaking through the kitchen ceiling and possible mold I obviously had to call for maintenance toe check it out.  I sent them a picture and they said they'd probably have to tear open the ceiling to find the source of the small leak and take out any mold parts of the ceiling.  

Obviously in normal times this would be no issue at all.  But I am a 31 year old high risk male (asthma) with already existing cases of extreme anxiety/depression/hypochondria.  So even though my wife and I have been super careful through all of this, it still hasn't been a good time for me.  Constantly worrying even over the smallest possible encounters.  I have already posted here twice because of that.  

I have been having massive panic attacks the last 24 hours due to the impending visit from maintenance and I just thought I'de here because you all have been very helpful in the past.  And yes, I am currently seeking therapy/psychiatry during all of this.  

The maintenance people will be wearing masks and gloves.  I will be wearing a mask as well and standing about 10 feet away from them in the living room, or I'll possibly go upstairs.  But they will probably be here for a couple hours to get their job done, and am still massively concerned about particles lingering in the air.

We don't have central air in the apartment so we basically have no ventilation whatsoever, plus they may have to go into the basement, which is unfinished, musty, and humid.  It has been getting colder here though so humidity has gone down in Maine.  It'll be 45 degrees tomorrow.  

My wife has told me many times that we will probably be fine due to our low infection rates in Maine and the fact that even if one of them was infected, we will all be wearing masks.  I cleared off the the counters and fridge and intend to wipe down any areas they touch.  There are two windows in the kitchen that I can open during their visit (even if its chilly out) to air out the kitchen and get some ventilation, but the windows face our living room and am afraid of possible airflow bringing any particles in the air into our living room.  

I will probably stay upstairs for a while after they leave just to let the apartment air out for a while, and then go ahead and clean everything, but I am terrified of possible droplets lingering in the kitchen, with or without the windows being open.

It also worries me because Trump had a rally in Bangor (2 hours north) today and am worried one of the maintenance guys could've either gone to the rally or know someone who did.  I know that's ridiculous thinking, but that's how bad my paranoia has gotten.  I know we will all be wearing masks and distancing and the possibility of them even being infected is very low.  I was just hoping  I could hopefully get some peace of mind bying here, as it's helped me in the past.

I am sorry for the very long post.  I just wanted to be as detailed as possible,  as my one safe space during this whole thing is going to have outsiders in here, so my whole concept of safety is being screwed with right now.  Thank you for reading.  

TL;DR - Maintenanceing tomorrow.  We will all be wearing masks and distancing, but am still afraid of possible infection due to being high risk.  Should I open windows to air out or will that just blow any possible particles into the living room? Or will it help disperse them instead?",0,0.4,ji3o7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ji3o7i/maintenance_is_coming_tomorrow_and_i_am_panicking/,10,Support,2020-10-26,-23,213,-0.107981220657277

750,"bing too much A bit of background to start off. I’m about to turn 20 and I live in the Midwestern US. I’m female and a college student. At the start of the pandemic, I didn’t care at all. I just proceeded with life as usual. Came to some stark realizations, and quit my job and all of my relationships out of guilt. Soon after, I found a subleaser for the first place of my own I was supposed to move into and am still living with my parents, doing school from home, andpletely financially stagnant. 

This was fine at first, but now I am starting to lose it. It seems like everyone I know is living life, going on trips, hanging out without social distancing, and being young and happy. I feel like I’m rotting. I’m about to turn 20 and I have no friends, no love in my life, and I don’t even remember what having fun feels like. 

I just feel so empty. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. No one where I live cares anymore, but cases are rising so fast. I know I’m doing the right thing morally, but mentally, I’m far from okay. I want to live in my 20’s. I want to fall in love. I want to move out of my parent's house. I want to party and have fun. I just feel so stuck. I see everyone else living with roommates, traveling, creating relationships, and having fun in life!

751,"feeling mentally exhuasted and ""old"" + college worries Hello there! I realize there's a lot of posts here a day, so thank you for taking the time to read mine. I'm a 20 year old who was supposed to start college this year and had to defer to the fall (when I'm 21) since I was 16 things haven't been great mental health wise and I've been housebound for a lot of that time due to disability. I know 21 isn't much older than a typical freshman (technically a transfer student but I'm in freshman year again) but I already feel like I missed out on so many years of doing things and living life that are supposed to be fun.

The pandemic obviosuly hasn't made anything better, and I feel like I'll feel so drained overall by the time its safe to do everything again (lets hope thats by next fall???? Is that looking good?) It doesn't help I see my one friend every five months now. Myparents have friends they can see outdoors, my brother has friends to see at the skate park, and I'm just stuck in the house, can't even get a job atm because my mom is working and because of my vision I can't drive)

Things have just been rough for a long time, and I feel like by the time I'm 21 I won't even know how to make new friends anymore, or won't be able to have the same experience in college as if I went younger, if that makes any sense. Plus I'm scared that I'm graduating at 25 and don't even know 100% what I want to do (I'd like to be a civil rights attorney, but school is so expensive and the job market isn't great) I don't really know what the point of this is, it's just hard like it is for everyone else, I hope y'all are doing alright.

Over the past few months, “hold on for a few more month” has turned into “hold on for a few more years”. At first we were supposed to be able to go back to some kind of normalcy by next summer. Then it got pushed to next winter. Now, Fauci and other experts are saying we won’t go back to normal until MAYBE the summer of 2022.

755,"Cleaning surfaces & groceries - Obsessivepulsive disorder? 1st of all English is not my native language, apologies. I´ve been following the spread of sars-cov-2 around the world since January but it became a real concern in late March here in Mexico, anyway  
In April i started with this ""safety protocol"" of my own, which means washing groceries with soap and water and a sponge of course, taking out my shoes and wearing a regular surgical facemask...

*Late April*.  
I thought: *""wait... I shouldn't bring groceries inside the house, what happens if something is contaminated?""* so i stopped washing groceries and packages inside, instead, i did it outside in the front yard, we have this ""garage"" entrance far from our bedrooms, living room, kitchen and it has a bathroom, it was the best idea to do all the cleaning right there but guess what? it wasn't enough, my head was getting worse...  
 

*May.*  
 I asked my brother to help me with this ""safety protocol"" to ""improve it"". I'd wash everything outside, then throw it inside and my brother  would clean everything again, a second time!! just to be sure none of those virus survive a 2nd ""filter"" of soap and water.  
That was the time when i read about covid survival on different surfaces... damn bug last for hours even several days over plastic or glass!!!   
 

*June.*  
Now i wouldn't dare step inside and walk around with the clothes i was wearing. From now on i'd place my clothes inside a plastic bag for some days then wash with hot water and lots of laundry soap... including the plastic bag.  
But... *the outside of the bag could be contaminated*, you know, the moment i took off  my clothes something may have fallen to the ground, some particles idk so i have this spray bottle and my best friend called ""Bleach"" what did i do? the obvious thing for this messed up head... bleach the hell out of the bag.  
Weeks later i wasn't satisfied, so i started with the mop, bleach and water to clean all the floor, also i told my brother to leave the area asap so i can mop the floor, plus take a shower and stay away from me because i was ""contaminated"". At this point cleaning groceries became a very difficult task but i wouldn't risk the safety of my family just to save time...  
Got new N95 masks, different models even 3m respirator with disposable filters, rubber boots, hazmat suit.. but i don't use those for grocery cleaning, way too much work but now i wear N95 and surgical mask at the same time  
 

*July & August*   
i take a ""pre-shower"" in the garage bathroom, i soap myself entirely, from neck to toes. My family tells me our pets could get poisoned by the amount of bleach i use (can't control cats) so now i have to spend more time doing 2nd even 3rd cleaning pass with water to remove any bleach residue on the floor.  
Oh yeah did i forgot to tell ya? i throw my face mask, protective glasses, safety hat and gloves inside a bucket with bleach and water then wash everything with soap. When i finish the  grocery cleaning i mop the garage, the hallway that connects to main house and all the way to my bathroom, like if im leaving behind some *contamination* trail, then i take a proper shower... I do all this half naked (remember, clothes are inside the bag).  
 

*September & October*  
Can´t walk around with the flip flops i use inside my room, now i have one pair for my room and another for the rest of the house, i wash both when i take my shower.  
Rubbing alcohol? hand sanitizer? i've spent a fortune, literally not having alcohol gives me anxiety.   
Now after cleaning groceries or returning from the street, i spray myself with bleach/water solution, i don't wanna touch anything outside my room and if i do it i must wash my hands immediately , my family thinks I'm beyond repair that i am totally crazy and i agree but can't help it seriously, i rather spend 8 hours cleaning groceries and taking showers than living the day with thoughts about fomites  
 

What can i do? people not wearing masks doesn't help, the damn virus survives way too long in different surfaces, i haven´t eat  pizza since May, i've lost 20 pounds, i don't trust people... Just canned food and packaged stuff. Btw i wash my hands like 20 times every day, sometimes even more. Should i get psychiatric/professional help? hell no! I'm not going out there to stay in one room with a total stranger for hours... What do you think? do i have OCD and extreme paranoia?  
 

is it really necessary to do so much cleaning? how long does it take for diluted bleach to kill the virus?  sun exposure for some minutes kills it? I do all this insanity 6 to 7 times a month, doesn't sound too bad right? well each time it takes like 7 to 9 hours, *wait what? why so much time?* obsessivepulsive, can't think of any other reason.

Caught me by surprise because I did not expect to receive a message from anyone. We made small talk and he asked me if we would meet up.

I didn't give him a response right away because, well, we're still under a pandemic and im very cautious with my health and also with my family's health. 

But honestly, i've been stuck at home for sooo long. 

Maybe going out at least one time won't be so bad, But then, i think about catching the virus (since i don't know if he has been distancing like i have)

maybe i'm being too paranoid? I really don't know.

If I go out with him that means that i can't tell my family because they would tell me to not go.

758,"Just need some support right now I \[21F\] am really struggling to progress with my life and find reasons to stay afloat in the midst of this COVID-19 mess. I'm in my 4th year of college (though I'm not expected to graduate until 2022, thankfully), and the new ""hybrid"" (aka almostpletely online) mode of classes at my school has been really problematic overall this semester. I had to drop 2 classes out of the 4 classes I originally planned toplete this semester for COVID-related reasons -- one class had technical issues every day with making lectures accessible for those attending remotely, and the other was taught by a demanding professor who became defensive and regularly made threats (e.g. making the final exam worth 90%+ of our overall class grade, making us use Honorlock instead of open notes toplete all exams, shortening ""open-note"" quick quizzes that were already only 10 minutes long to reduce ability to look at notes, etc.) in response to us simply asking questions about the format of the course -- and it's so difficult to stay motivated in the 2 classes I am taking due to how depressing everything is right now, in addition to how depressing things already were right before COVID due to my grandfather's passing near the end of 2019 and the increased anxiety and depression I experienced immediately following his passing.

I'm also autistic (was diagnosed at the age of 4), and partly as a result of this, I have struggled to make friends in the traditional sense my whole life. I very frequently had no friends I could socialize with during my growing-up years (despite my own efforts to take initiative and reach out to people), and even when I did have a few good friends, I've nearly always had to be the one to reach out in order for socialization to be possible. Even then, nearly all of them eventually left in favor of ""better"" friends (I feel very much like a back-up/convenience friend as a result of this), and it has resulted in me feeling very unwanted, unloved, and lonely with abandonment issues. These feelings have only gotten worse during the pandemic, especially since it's even harder to talk with others right now and I constantly hear about how much harder it apparently is to make friends after college.

Another weird thing I've noticed with my social life is that older adults (family friends, former teachers, other older adults in themunity) tend to gravitate toward me (and vise versa) much more easily than to many same-age people I know, whereas I really struggle with making and especially maintaining friendships with people near my age. I don't really know why this is the case, though people have said I am mature for my age and an ""old soul"", so maybe this contributes? Either way, it feels almost wrong/taboo that this is the case (though I have enjoyed the friendships I've made with older adults), and I wish it was easier to make friends near my age (in addition to the older adult friendships I've maintained), in part due to a fear of being alone after the older adults I know pass on.

I also have a difficult time dealing with even minor uncertainty/changes of plan/spontaneity, partly as a result of being autistic, so the constant feelings of major uncertainty resulting from the pandemic have resulted in my brain being in a constant haywire mode. (When will I be able to see higher-risk family and friends again? I, fortunately, got an internship offer recently for Summer 2021 -- what will the pandemic situation look like then? When will all of this end? 2021? 2022? Never?! Nobody even knows the stages of getting out of this pandemic -- though it doesn't help that our administration in the U.S. is a joke -- let alone when it will end, if ever.)

On top of all of that, I also have a semi-abusive home situation (my mother has been incredibly supportive of me my whole life, but she gets angry and starts yelling at my dad and/or me very easily as a result of a dysfunctional childhood, and I sometimes don't even know what I did that caused her to start yelling at me until after the yelling starts) that made things worse when I was forced to leave my college campus and return home to my parents in March. Staying at home, 24/7 (my parents are working from home now because of COVID), for 5 months with a mother whose tendency to scold, argue, and/or yell over every little thing worsened (understandably) because of pandemic-induced stress (both my parents take the pandemic very seriously, thankfully, she was just stressed about the situation and other people not taking it seriously) was not a pleasant experience, and I'm a little nervous about going back to my parents' house for a month and a half during Thanksgiving Break due to not knowing how to effectively handle these situations (I've lost count of the number of times I had to excuse myself from dinner before dinner even started because my parents would not stop arguing and/or yelling at each other at the table, and at one point this summer my mom started full-on screaming and slamming doors at my dad and me for the first time since she abused alcohol during my middle school years).

I'm typically a very ambitious person who cares about doing the best I can in what I do to progress toward long-term goals in life, but at this point, I don't really have any dreams I'm excited about at all, and I'm honestly just trying to get through the semester and make sure I'm actually still alive at the end of it all (I have had suicidal thoughts on and off since May, and while I am currently in counseling for anxiety and depression, it hasn't been enough to ovee the overwhelming dark thoughts I experience so frequently), and even then, it's hard to have any hope anymore with the current pandemic and with climate change looming just around the corner.",40,0.98,jh0olj,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jh0olj/just_need_some_support_right_now/,6,Support,2020-10-24,-22,345,-0.06376811594202898

I'm 35, no known underlying conditions, and I'm hardly ever ill, so I might be OK even if I do get it, but I'm an anxious person and I can't shift the feeling it'll be terrible, and I'll be in hospital etc.

I'm doing the best I can to stay home. I only go out once a day for a jog in an empty park.

However, my wife goes out quite a bit. She takes our baby to a socially distanced baby class, and travels to another UK city once a month to visit her family for a few days. Her family seem relatively sensible so I'm hoping it's safe.

We visit supermarkets a few times a week wearing masks and it's a short 10 min trip and that's unavoidable.

Apart from that, we don't go out.

I can't seem to find anyone living near me who has had it, and Bristol is one of the lowest UK cities in terms of infections and death rates, so I should be optimistic.

However, all I read about is people my age dying, and people having serious problems. I can't seem to find any accounts of people who just had a mild case.

Do these accounts exist? I think they would be reasuring.",1,1,jhfthh,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jhfthh/anyone_from_bristol_uk_who_caught_it/,1,Questions,2020-10-25,-3,75,-0.04

Businesses are open at 100% capacity and cases are skyrocketing. It would be nice to work again and get out of my house but I feel conflicted that it will make me a guilty party in the spread of this virus.

762,"Netherlands to New York after positive test Hi,

My girlfriend with dual citizenship ising home to New York from the Netherlands next month.

She tested positive for covid just under a month ago and never showed any symptoms (she did quarantine for 2 weeks and continues to be very careful)

How does quarantining work for this?

Does she still have to quarantine for 2 weeks even though she has a positive test and no symptoms?

If she does have to quarantine, do I have to quarantine if I see her? Or do I just need to be on high alert for any symptoms in myself? Can we kiss?

Even with or without the quarantining, are we going to be able to kiss at all? I could have sworn I read that the virus can still shed but I don't know if that would get to me through kissing at all.

763,"Am I Being Paranoid? So, my family knows my situation, they know the risks and and they have decided that seeing me outweighs the risk of catching the virus, which I understand. The mental toll of being away from family is worse to them, and I empathize with that. 

Anyway, I have been experiencing allergies this season, as many of us have been. It's an off and on thing; drainage, sore throat, and snot in the back of my throat. The news has confirmed that there is some sort of mold on the leaves in our area that's wrecking people lol now, I am very lucky! I don't have allergies as bad as some people. My poor boyfriend is allergic to the whole of the earth, bless him. So, I count my blessings.

I had a sore throat for about 3 days last week. It has since passed and I feel fine. I felt fine even with the sore throat. It seemed to get worse after sleeping, which I attribute to drainage. 

The doctor I work with also said it was probably just an allergic reaction to the leaves and various pollens in the air and that it would pass. My family said the same thing. 

Now, for my main question... Halloween ising up!!! I am soooooo excited! It's the best holiday ever! 
We expect to have a lot of kidse by. 

Every year, we make individual candy bags and hand them out. That way, every kid gets the same stuff and no one gets left out. 

I realized this year that it's also a good idea because all the candy is wrapped separately and the bags will allow for sanitizing if the parents so choose! 

Do y'all think it's safe for me to wrap these bags and hand out candy? 

We stand outside, the interactions are short, kids are wearing costumes with masks for the most part, I will be masked up, and I will never touch any unwrapped candy. 

Even though I've had everyone tell me that it's probably allergies, I'm one of those people who always second guesses lol 

Getting tested in my area is very difficult. You have to have a specific set of symptoms before you can get tested.

766,"Hearing about the distancing until 2022 is the last straw. I dropped out of university because of COVID due to not being able to study in my small apartment with no space and family I don’t get along with. I am an extrovert with mental health problems and I love to be around people and I cannot stand masks.

769,"Word-salad about lockdown. Having a crappy time and trying to express it. I need to write something, somewhere about this. I don't necessarily expect anyone to read it or to say anything in response. It's probably pretentious and overdramatic, but hey ho. At least I might be able to stop thinking about things for a while once I've vomited some words into the page. 

The long and the short of it is, everything feels intensely precarious at the moment. Emotionally in particular, but I feel like it cuts deeper than that. I don't just mean that I'm occasionally sad, I mean that I can be coping and trundling along and then *wham*. There's this sense of vertigo, like you're thrown out of your own body for a split-second and back and feel like you've been doused in cold water. The gnawing anxiety, low-level panic and bone-deep emotional fatigue. 

Ites in waves - not the kind you can ever seeing. It's constantly being blind-sided by every new thing, until you be focused on putting one foot in front of the other just to *survive*. To think about the idea of a future is just to remind yourself of its absence, of the things that have been taken away. We're locked in a stodgy, temporally stagnant pseudopresent where both everything and nothing is happening all at once. 

And I'm writing this from a place ofparative materialfort. I danced the 'guilt that it could be worse and I've no right toplain' dance, but that leads to not recognising that something *bad* is happening. It could be and *is* worse for many people, but it doesn't mean this isn't shit. I'm tired of feeling hollowed out, like I've some kind of existential fucking anaemia. There's no motivation or drive to do *anything*. 

I've grappled with depression and anxiety in my life enough to know that this feels different. Thosee when something inside you quietly gives way and you manage things carefully while you heal. This is external, cloying. That even when you're outside or about you're not really there. I met up with a friend last week (socially distanced, outside) and the conversation was stilted, performative and not-quite-real. 

I'm tired. I'm tired that it feels like nothing is mine anymore. It's not that things are broken, it's that they're gone. The oxygen has been sucked out of the room and we're all holding our breath. There's no up, no down, no past, no future. Just distraction or procrastination from a yawningly infinite but empty present. Even my work feels like procrastination from ... All this? When I know precisely our allotted role is to stay indoors, stay sane and *not*.

I understand why we lock down and wear masks. I understand that we're protecting the most vulnerable. I get it that this is for a 'Greater Good'; that it 'requires sacrifice and we all need to pull together'. The scale of the 'big thing' we're (in theory) united against makes it sacrilege to see or address the million lesser evils springing up all around us. The best will be - can be - a conciliatory pat-on-the-shoulder before we go back to our new normal. And it's... Well... All just a bit much. And I don't know what the fuck to do.

770,"Daughter going back to preschool, husband at-risk Looking for suggestions on keeping everyone safe and potential supplements that may have evidence for benefit.

One of my kids' school is reopening. They seem to have a good plan in place, lots of cleaning, screening, everyone wears masks (including the kids) and a stable group of 12 or less. 

Right now, we all take a multivitamin, vitamin D, and a fish oil omega 3 supplement. We occasionally use melatonin, but not daily.

My husband takes a lot of meds because he hasplete kidney failure, these include meds for blood clotting, cholesterol, etc.

I have on hand extra zinc, however he can't take more than the kidney vitamin levels of zinc because like many other minerals, it can build up in kidney patients. The multis for the rest of us have 100-125% of the RDA for zinc.

Are there any other supplements and meds we should be asking his doctor about? We will clear it with the doctor for safety before using any.

Right now the plan is to just have my daughter have her bath right after school, toss those clothes in the wash, and try as best we can to limit her breathing or sneezing/coughing right in his face. I will also be assuming I could be exposed and will not be sleeping in the same room. If she gets sick, we will have him live as separately as possible, but there's only so much we can do.

What else is a possibility? Any new data on ivermectin? Famotidine? NAD, CoQ10, or others?

I haven't even thought about what I need to know in advance from him if he were to have to be in the hospital for long - nor what he would need to know from me if it was me. So advice there is probably also good.

772,"My mom was treated as expendable by her work. Now she’s sick. She’s a teacher at an elementary school is Texas. She teaches an elective in a group of three teachers, think three teachers for one giant class. Her coworkers didn’t take the virus seriously, and ate lunch together unmasked and went to happy hour at restaurants after work. My mom was ostracized by them when she stayed masked and distant- people said she was overreacting, being “too much.”

A student tested positive. School rolled the dice and did absolutely nothing. My mom got voluntarily tested, as she was in a closed class room with the student. Thankfully negative. I cannot stress HOW much NOTHING the school did. Told her “student didn’t have symptoms so couldn’t have spread it.” 

Three weeks later, another student tests positive. School rolls the dice again, do nothing- no quarantining the student’s peers or the teachers involved with the student. Three students test positive. Two teachers test positive. And then my moms direct coworker tests positive, one of the people eating lunching unmasked, sharing a table with others. 

So now one of the three teachers in her group is positive. They called the second teacher and told her to quarantine for 14 days and get tested on the schools dime. Told my mom to show up at 7 am the next day like usual. I guess they wanted her to be a martyr? To risk spreading it to the students? Mom once again got voluntarily tested, called the district COVID nurse. Nurse wouldn’t say that my mom should stay home, despite being near two positive cases. Nurse eventually and angrily relented.

774,"Post Covid Anxiety and my hellish few months. I contracted Covid in July from an irresponsible co-worker. It started with body aches and severe fatigue and graduated to a light cough, stuffy nose and other mild symptoms. I spent two weeks in a state of constant anxiety and relying on xanax because i was afraid I (or my brother who was also sick) was going to give the Covid to my parents. I was also constantly afraid that a month from then, me and my older sister would be planning my parent's funeral. Blessedly, we made it through and neither of my parents got sick despite all of us living in the same house. Even though we got past that dark time, however, i haven't really been doing well mentally. 

Early September i got some very debilitating fatigue after a swim in cold water. I spent 5 days in bed exhausted and in that time I was obsessively scrolling the internet and convinced myself that I had Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and that i was going to be spending the rest of my life in a state of weakness and constant dependence on my family. I even had to give my pistol to my family because i was afraid that I would use it on myself the more i ruminated on the possibility that I would never get to live the life i sought after having graduated college recently. I couldnt sleep and every time i closed my eyes, i kept having these weird waking dreams that wouldnt go away and i had to take xanax every night just to fall asleep and get some rest even though insomnia wasmon that first week.  
   During the next week, the severe debilitating anxiety overtook me as the fatigue subsided and I convinced myself that i had heart problems from covid, neurological issues, etc. My heart was constantly racing, my breath was shallow and the slightest thing set me off. It all culminated in one night where i was about to fall asleep only to wake up with my heart racing and somehow  i got it in my head that if i fell back asleep, my heart would stop. So for two weeks i was hovering in between wanting to die and being afraid to die and i think i cried more at that time more than any other point in my life. Thankfully i had my family to reassure me but it was not something i was proud of, to have been so...it made me feel weak.   
  The next day or so we took a spontaneous family trip to a small town nearby to have breakfast (outside, social distance) and i realized that some of the symptoms i had were also anxiety. Constant fear of impending doom, heart racing, etc. All the symptoms the mayo clinic had for anxiety attacks, I had. Hell i was so anxious that when my parents were planning other trips in the future like camping or other stuff (trying to reassure me), i didnt really want to think about it or plan anything to look forward to because i didnt know if i was going to be around long enough to really make plans. Thats where my head was at. 

  
   This all culminated the Monday after two weeks of this intense mental suffering in me seeing a therapist and a doctor on the same day. The therapist basically gave me techniques on how tobat anxiety and intrusive thoughts and my doctor, most importantly, gave me a clean bill of health. No heart issues, no lung problems, nothing. Even after an EKG. As it turns out, it was all just severe debilitating anxiety. The fatigue was real and no one really knows where it came from but its possible it might have just been some sort of reaction from swimming in freezing cold water for an hour. Everything after that however was just the most severe anxiety ive ever had. Another important thing i learned is that anxiety and stress hormones in your body can actually cause you to feel sick and reinforce your anxiety. After I realized that most of it was in my head and that it was just a severe mental health issue, i just tried to move on, look for a job and try to find a direction for my life. Still those two weeks were probably one of the darker times in my life and i dont think i could read the things i wrote in my journal at that time.  


  What brings me back to that now is that the other day I woke up with a stiff neck and tired and this morning i woke up with a sore-ish throat. and ever since then ive been wondering if i contracted Covid again. Up till now i have been falling back on news reports that one is immune for atleast 3 months after having had Covid and i estimated that i wasing out of that period of immunity. Now earlier I did read that new studies show that you are immune for 5-7 months after contracting covid so i have that to fall back on. Its possible that  maybe having my fan on with this cold weather has me a little sick. And maybe my neck is stiff because I slept wrong. And maybe i was tired the other day from poor sleep and maybe a side effect of taking a xanax last night. Its probably not Covid. But the anxiety that has plagued me the last few months never has that possibility far from my mind. When I was sick i was afraid that I could wipe out my whole family with just my breath and all those things i felt then came back to me as soon as i remembered that my bout with covid started with waking up with my entire body aching and feeling fatigued. I mean, confirmed cases of getting re-infected, i gather, are incredibly rare and im sure it would be alot more well known if people were getting re-infected but god damn this time period is so fucking scary. And I'm afraid. And I guess that is all there is to it. I deal with a form of high functioning autism and one thing i learned about that is that people like me operate from a baseline of anxiety anyway so this year has been particularly difficult for me. Now im grateful that my family is okay and we are not dealing with the same issues other people are, but its been pretty bad mental-health wise. So yea. There's that.

775,"Boyfriend not being as cautious as I am about COVID-19 My boyfriend and I are both teachers at the same school district. We have been back in person for a few weeks now, and since we’ve been back, we haven’t physically been together aside from outdoor walks with masks on (we’ve been quarantining from each other because I believe the school buildings are high risk). So far we’ve had about 4 positive COVID cases in our district and that building (which is neither of ours) shut down for 2 weeks.

At school, I wear a KF94 mask (BOTN) that isn’tpletely sealed on my face (some air gets out under my chin), but i feel it’s protecting me much better than a regular surgical mask or a cloth mask. I’ve also been very careful about quarantining in my own home away from my parents (separate bathroom, never eating together inside, only talking to them outside or with a mask on, etc.). As far as I knew, my boyfriend was doing the same as me, except it sounds like if he’s quickly passing through amon area, he doesn’t wear his mask. 

My boyfriend is somewhat cautious (e.g., he doesn’t do indoor dining, parties, bars, etc.), but not nearly as cautious as I am. The mask he wears at school is very loose cotton one (he can’t tolerate anything tight or restricting). It’s loose enough where I don’t feelfortable being next to him indoors which was sad for the both of us. 

I just spoke with him and found out that earlier today he was talking to his parents indoors for about 10 minutes “10 feet away” without a mask on. I was very shocked to hear that and it makes me feel like he doesn’t understand how COVID works when it’s been extremely clear that indoor spaces with poor ventilation for a prolonged period of time are BAD. He did get a negative COVID test on Tuesday, and has only been in school today (Thursday), but those tests are not always accurate, plus, for all he knows, he could have been exposed to COVID today. 

It just is very upsetting to me that I’m sacrificing a lot to keep myself and my family safe, and it doesn’t seem like he is, which in turn makes me scared to be in person with him indoors / without masks on because his higher risk will be my risk. I’ve spoken to him about it and he’s understanding, but it’s just not in his personality to be as cautious about it as I am. 

Am I being irrational about this or overly cautious? I’m thankful he’s not doing anything super risky, but still... :(",4,0.84,jgfxh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jgfxh3/boyfriend_not_being_as_cautious_as_i_am_about/,19,Support,2020-10-23,-9,130,-0.06923076923076923
776,"My coworker’s daughter was exposed to COVID — help talk me down of anxiety I work in a small office with 5 people. One of my co-workers called out today because her teenage daughter was notified last night that a friend she went to the park with on Saturday is COVID positive. The office has no open windows and despite reminders and the fact that everyone else masks up at their desks and while walking around, she hardly ever wears one. She does sit in an office about 20 feet away from me, but my other coworker who interacts with me often, shared a cigarette with her (so saliva swapping involved) just yesterday and also walks past my area to go to the bathroom. 

The truth is that if she is positive, I guess I’ve already been exposed. It also helps that I had COVID back in March already, and hopefully my antibodies remember what to do and possibly fight off an infection.  I’m hoping that our interactions were so minimal that I’ll be ok but worry about my coworkers getting sick in the next 14 days and living in paranoia this whole time.

My fear: Being infected on the exam day and being unable to do the exam. I really missed my school and having to wait another month because of an infection JUST BY STAYING HOME.

I'm also extremely distrusting of COVID-19 tests. When my dad coughed, I thought it was over. Then, my dad said that he wasn't infected bu my mind says that he is a false negative and he is in fact, INFECTED. When he coughed, he closed his mouth with his hand but I'm still deathly paranoid.

I know it's very unrealistic as I was only ""exposed"" for second and that was his only cough (meaning it isn't a symptom) but I still can't distract myself because that thought literally controls me.

778,"Freaking out, counting my odds of exposure My brother and his girlfriend (both 18) live with me (21M) at my parent’s house (mom is 49, has asthma; dad is 58, has one kidney). We’ve survived the pandemic mostly unscathed: my mom’s business where both me and my brother work are all masked up and my dad works from home.

This past Saturday (10/17), my brother’s gf’s work threw a party where almost everyone at her work was there, except her. Yesterday (10/21) a person at her work, who is mostly on the opposite end of the building, was in a meeting with her, within 6 feet, more than 15 minutes, without a mask.

Today (10/22), he tested positive.

My brother’s girlfriend isolated immediately upon hearing the news and is no longer at our house, and will be tested soon. She has no symptoms, and neither does my brother or me or my parents.

What are the odds of the contagion train going from her coworker -&gt; her -&gt; my brother -&gt; everyone else in the house? As far as I know, his girlfriend is always masked at work, and to reiterate, she works on the opposite side of the building from her coworker, and I’m assuming they’re all masked as well (mandated by our city, but enforcement is iffy as usual).

It’s worth mentioning while we are a close family unit, my brother and his girlfriend don’t have much contact with me or my parents. The girlfriendes home late at night, says hi and chats for a couple of minutes before going to my brother’s room, limited potential exposure. We don’t hang around and chat at the dinner table too often, and we weren’t doing that this past week.

It’s also worth mentioning that the only real exposure I’ve had from her was a car ride the same day she was exposed (the meeting without masks more than 15 minutes within 6 feet), but I don’t think I should be too worried about that seeing that you’re not really contagious immediately after exposure, correct? 

My brother’s worried for her and for himself and for everyone else here. I’m worried for them too, although I am reassured that they will likely be fine. Young, spry, and healthy young adults, they are, as am I. My parents, a bit less so. Any support will go a long way.

A close family member recently died from cancer and my family had dinner after dinner, many get togethers, the funeral, ect. All indoors and with no masks or social distancing. And many people from out of state were there, too. Dozens of people, probably at least 50, hugging, crying and eating together, with not a single mask in sight.

I wear my mask, I socially distance, I've drastically changed my own life and habits to help protect us all. :'(

793,"In an open relationship and my partner is showing interest in hooking up again. So this is tough andplicated obviously. 

Im 39, have a preexisting condition(asthma), and I work in food service. My partner is 30, and does food delivery. We are both considered essential workers and haven’t stopped working since the pandemic started. 

Luckily we havent had covid or anyone super close to us haven’t either. 

My view on the matter is that the environment, politically or scientifically, is not safe. I don’t 100% trust testing, and people, especially when people are trying to hook up. I believe we are still new into this pandemic and there is still a lot to learn before I would feelfortable hooking up again. 

My partner on the other hand, agrees with my logic but thinks that they are able to have “safe” encounters. He also thinks that their work doesn’t allow him to shelter in place. And puts themselves at risk daily for work. 
So they believe that they can find sexual partners that would be no more risky than the daily risks he goes through already. They believe that they could find encounters that would be even safer than a day on the job. 

This makes me nervous. For his health, my health, and the people we share space with. We live with roommates and we already have a pod of platonic friends we see often. 

Ultimately, I said it makes me too uneasy for either one of us to hook up currently. And that we should wait till we get through with winter and see where the world is at. I had to ask whether my partner would feelfortable hooking up with people after finishing up our conversation. 
He said NO because I didn’t feelfortable with the situation. 
I have to tell you that I saw a make it or break it situation appear. I thought maybe I would have to decide to continue or break up our relationship if they were unwilling topromise. Scary moment. 

But thankfully, he listens. Cares about me. And cares enough to be together still. 

I do love him. And wish I could give him the blessing to have whatever sexual fun they feel like searching.

794,"Online graduate school is making me depressed I started my masters in public health back in July with high hopes and genuine excitement. I actually loved my undergraduate experience and school. I enjoyed going to classes, studying, doing research, and participating in academic interest groups outside of classes. I took a few years off and was so excited to start graduate school. Especially now, getting a public health education in the middle of a pandemic? I knew the education format would be different, but I felt that would outweigh the passion and drive to make a positive impact on the pandemic during/after my graduation.

Pretty quickly that passion disappeared and now I feel like a genuine shell of the human being I used to be before school started. I spend most of my days passively watching pre-recorded lectures, because my education is close to 80% asynchronous. My eyes and head fucking hurt from looking at aputer screen all day. I don't feel engaged with my coursework in the slightest. I have zero new friends, and my school has done one single virtual networking event since the program began. Every day feels like a genuine waste of time. I have lost passion for the subject matter and this loss of passion has trickled into facets of my every day life. I get angry more easily, I feel tired all the time, and I find it hard to initiate my actual hobbies. I genuinely have no idea what my career plans are anymore because I feel so disengaged from everything that I cannot even fathom a career in something I give so few shits about right now.

I am already planning on delaying my graduation and taking a reduced courseload until we can resume in-person activities. Now I am considering deferring altogether, but unless I live exclusively off of savings for longer than I had anticipated, I have no idea what I would do in the meantime to make money (I currently get a small stipend for being enrolled into a certain amount of credits). A huge part of me is worried that I have been so jaded and let down from this experience that I still won't care even when we do return to everything as normal.

I am in therapy already, have been for about a year now. But prior to grad school, I was doing well enough to make it a once every few months thing. Nowadays its bing a semi-every week thing. I don't think a day goes by where I am not frustrated/defeated/apathetic.

In the last week there has been a barbecue with a handful of guests and another gathering indoors with maybe 3 or 4 people on top of the odd scattered visitor. And to cap it off he just rented a room to a woman just flown in from a country with far higher cases without isolating.

I'm basically keeping my distance as much as possible but my refusal to go downstairs and engage with her family is causing some strain between myself and my wife.

Things have been a little better for me mental health-wise over the summer as the pandemic wound down here in Germany during the summer but things have really been escalating again for the last 2 weeks in my region. I also have allergies all year long, which also have worsened the last few weeks and I'm always unsure wheter symptoms I have are from allergies or COVID and this is driving me crazy. I barely leave the house anymore.

810,"Family member may have gotten exposed to COVID from a student. What should we do? Super scared... I am a 22 year old female who graduated in 2019. I work as an engineer, and although we have been mainly working remotely, there have been a couple of times where I had to physically go into the office to do some lab work. So far it hasn't been an issue, since I was always the only one there and I wore a mask anyway and washed my hands before touching anything personal. I also live with my family (a 17 year old brother and my parents, both are 51 years old).

My mom works as a teacher, and unfortunately she has had to go back to the classroom for face-to-face instruction (none of us were happy about this ofc cuz of how risky it is to be face-to-face with 70 teenagers a day). Anyways, it has been about a week and a half, and unsurprisingly she gets news that one of her students has tested positive for COVID, and that another student needed to get tested because she felt sick the past few days. This second student will get the results tomorrow and notify her instructors. What made us all absolutely livid is that this student (a 15 year old girl) has apparently been feeling sick over the past few days, but her parents still allowed her to go to school (I guess they just wrote it off as a ""simple cold""). I guess it got bad enough that she finally decided to go get the test done. The scary part is...her desk is only \~10 ft away from where my mom stands and teaches.

My question is...now what? My mom says that all her students have been really good about keeping their masks on so far...even this girl who came to school despite feeling sick. My mom also wears a KN95 mask with a surgical mask underneath, as well as a face shield at all times, unless it's lunchtime where she is the only one in class and she finally gets to eat.

I am admittedly pretty scared, and circling back to the lab thing I mentioned at the start of my post...I was supposed to go in this Friday for lab stuff with another engineer. Now that two of my mom's students may have possibly exposed her to COVID, should I cancel my shift this week to protect the other engineer I was supposed to be working with (cuz it's like...what are the odds that I also got exposed)? And I also had a socially distanced date planned with my bf this weekend (we were gonna go for a walk in the park with masks on). My mom has also been wearing a mask in the house to protect us.

TLDR: Mom (who I live with) is a high school teacher, and has two students who concern us...one tested positive and another is getting test but came to school with symptoms for the past few days. Mom wears a KN95 mask, face shield, and surgical mask, and all her students also wear masks. She also keeps her physical distance from students, although one student who concerns us does sit a little too close forfort (\~7-10 feet away). How likely is it that my mom has been exposed to the virus? How about myself? Should I avoid contact with people (even if it's in a socially distanced manner) in the meantime and cancel my shift and date (like would it be bad not to)? I am scared of getting someone sick, but idk....

However, it is a LONG flight, and I will have a full day of transiting even though I chose the fastest option. I have 20-ish hours of flying, a short one hour layover and another few hours for being in airports.

I have been incredibly careful, and stayed quarantined for the majority of the pandemic (I'd say 100%, but I've moved around a little and seen some people, though always following guidelines). I think I'm a little more relaxed than I was at first, but not by much, and I'm very on my guard in any kind of public setting. I'd honestly prefer it if I didn't have to eat or drink, but realistically I can't go for THAT long without food or water. I worry about aerosol transmissions in airports specifically as well. I am also aware that the airline I'm flying with doesn't mandate masks for children. Given all these parameters, what can I do? I'm thinking of getting a straw to slip under my mask to drink water, and I'll probably bring some food bars. I know a face shield isn't good enough on its own, but would it be helpful while eating? I'm up in the air about goggles, too.

813,"Life feels so empty right now. 16 year old male here, just wanted to put my thoughts out there for people read, it's therapeutic for me. I'm totally open to advice, discussion, whatever. I posted this on r/self as well.

A couple hours ago I went down a rabbit hole of all my old pictures from last year and it put me in a terrible mood, I cried for nearly an hour. Life was good, I had so many pictures with friends and I looked genuinely happy in them, I was. I took so much for granted back then, I had many friends, I was fairly good looking, I got good grades in school, I did well with the ladies, I was charismatic -and often told so by people- and I was, for the most part, mentally stable. I'd say basically all of those things are no longer true today. COVID drained everything out of me and my life, I feel so empty inside.

90% of my friends stopped talking to me shortly after school got shut down, the few that stayed are the ones still keeping me afloat today. Without social interaction and my passion, swimming, I fell into a deep depression, worse than anything I've been through before. The effects are still with me today, I can see it clear as day just by looking at pictures. My skin is noticeably whiter, I've got a slight double chining in from gaining 10+ pounds, but most of all, my smile looks so fake and empty. I just no longer look happy in pictures, it's so forced. All of this isn't about my looks though, it's about who I've be. I'm so empty inside, and my physical appearance is the best way to see that. I no longer get to take those fun group pictures with friends either, just a couple pictures my mom decides to take when we're doing something together.

While I was crying, I was thinking about how much I want that time of my life back. COVID has left a sizable scar on my personality, and I don't see myself recovering within the next two years before I graduate. I know it's unhealthy to live in the past, but I find it difficult to detach from it when I had it so good just a year ago.

I was only there for about 15-20 max because although it wasn't necessarily crowded & I kept many feet away from everyone, there were still more people there than I would've preferred and I felt weird. I was the only one in a mask at the actual beach. People had them on in the parking lot but took them off by the water.

He's offered to do whatever I want to ensure it's safe so I'm trying toe up with a plan but I don't really know what to say. I know he should isolate before and after testing but for how long? Should he get tested twice? He should probably start dialing back contact now but for how long and how far? He's really careful as it is but he's still  more exposed than me and I just don't know where the line of reasonableness is while still being safe. 

Would something like ""on Saturday start wearing masks around everyone including your normal contacts, on Monday start isolating, get tested Wednesday and Friday,e over Saturday"" would that make sense? I'd pay for the cost for the rapid result tests in this scenario.

816,"How safe are outdoor photoshoots? I made a post a few weeks back asking you guys if I would be safe to do a shoot (as a model), since it would be indoors and I wouldn't be able to wear a mask (whereas the photographer and makeup artist would be). I ended up turning down the job and not doing the shoot since I live with my parents, and the lack of ventilation concerned me enough that I just wasn't willing to take the risk.

Well...my agency wants to send me to another job, and I wanted to weigh the risks beforehand. The shoot is a outdoor fashion shoot with just me and the photographer, so not only is there proper ventilation this time around, but since I will also be doing my own makeup, no one unfamiliar will have to get super close to my face to do my makeup. The photographer will also be wearing a mask apparently. So with the fact that the shoot will be outdoors, the photographer will be masked, and the fact that it will just be the two of us, I am not *as* worried as I was before.

What *does* concern me however, is the fact that I will have to do a couple of outfit changes for this shoot. The photographer said she will be bringing the outfits, but my concern is...does the fact that I will be changing into dresses that aren't my own introduce the possibility of virus exposure (worst case...if the photographer happened to have COVID and then sneezed on the dress before bringing it to the shoot, could I still get it)?

821,"I'm a 30 year old transwoman, and I chose the worst year toe out on. So I've spent the last 5-6 years struggling with depression. It's hard some nasty effects: one year in particular is basically gone from my memory, I struggled to do anything at all other than get out of bed in that year. Though I've managed to hold down jobs it's taken me until I'm 30 to find something that I feel I could stick and it works for me.

Still, I came out at work this year as trans, and from February onwards made real plans to build a new life. Move out of my parents' place. Find hobbies and join social groups. Make more friends. Do more creative things. And to be fair to myself, I managed some of it: I joined a wonderful dance group early in the year.

Funnily enough, Lockdown itself wasn't too bad. I appreciate that's an immensely priviliged thing to say, as thousands of people have died from Covid in my area alone, but living with my parents in a leafy suburb of the town I had access to nicepany, bright skies and fresh air at the local nature reserve 10 minutes down the road. Sure, I wasn't doing anything, but neither was anyone else; I felt like a had a permanent long holiday to do stuff in (and the fact I could work from home gave me some structure). Whilst everyone else was adjusting to having a slow, boring pace of life with few friends around, I was somewhat content, as I had been in that state for years.

But now...

The things that made the full Lockdown bearable have made semi-Lockdown hideous. 

The large dance class I loved still isn't running, replaced instead by a zoom class (which I hate, as I don't like showing my room to strangers--I guess I'm a private person).

The leafy suburb is outside the city (and all my friends in it) so to visit them or do anything that isn't filled with middle-aged folks I have to get on the metro for an hour.

My friends, who before were all in it together with me, have all started going to clubs, to events, to different cities even on their travels (nothing that breaks our restrictions though).

Whilst everyone else is going out and trying to enjoy themselves, I feel stuck at home. And there's nothing that stops me, other than my fear of Covid. It's not really a panic I guess (as I know I'm in a low-risk group), but I got something nasty at the beginning of the year, which I presume was just the flu, and I'm not in the mood for something worse.

I like being spontaneous, but the Pandemic hangs over everything like a cloud, and when I leave my house I feel like I have to keep looking over my shoulder to see if it's following me.

823,"I can't take the world we live in anymore It's just continuing to get worse for me mentally. I've already been depressed for months due to being isolated, socially distancing and having my travel plans shut down. Now I'm losing my job by the end if the year with the branch shutting down.

So now on top of having depression I have to look for a new job on top of it all. I also just get upset whenever I go out and see the kind of world we are living in right now. People wearing masks, seeing workers being glass, not being able to see any of my friends or other family members. Heck I'm sure seeing my girlfriend would be considered highly frowned upon. 

I just seriously can't take this anymore. Mentally I'm exhausted and just checked out. There's nothing I can do about it no matter how much I distract myself.

827,"Feels like I'm the last person isolated out of everyone I know Been feeling very depressed, lonely, and angry (it's been up and down) during this pandemic, and it's getting worse now that people are easing up more and more and starting to hang out and get back to normalcy despite still being in the midst of our second wave. 

I used to host fun small themed parties and get togethers at my house for years and would always try invite new people so that no one would feel excluded and everyone would get the chance to hang out at least once or twice. I had a nice handful of friends that would make it to these parties almost every time too. Anyway, ines the pandemic and that put an end to all that and I took it very seriously and barely went out except to get groceries or mail. For months I isolated at home with my husband and so did most of my friends. When things finally started easing up, I finally was able to see a handful of friends for a quick socially distanced brunch. That was several months ago and the last time I hung out with anyone. 

It's now been about 7 months and besides that one in-person hangout when things were opening up again, I've been pretty much isolated. We're experiencing our second wave here so I'm still taking it seriously since I have a weaker immune system and already got covid once in the beginning of May, which lasted for an agonizing month. My husband took it seriously in the beginning but he's been hanging out with friends more often despite me being ufortable with it and even asking him to not do it a couple times. 

I've been staying off social media for the most part but whenever I do check it, I'd see different groups of friends hanging out or having their own little parties which I never get invited to. Friends who don't live in the same place as I do are also going out and doing road trips to enjoy nature with a handful of other friends. I feel like everyone is hanging out now except me. Friends, family, my husband... and I just feel stuck at home and forgotten and it's so depressing and frustrating because I don't have a regular job to distract me, and only a couple of friends to text now and then. 

I've been diagnosed with depression many years ago and even got meds for it but didn't like how it made me feel so I never took them again. Just been managing shit on my own which has been really tough. Talking to my husband and a close friend via text every now and then has helped a bit, but it's still really tough and I'm struggling even more now during this pandemic and feel so down and upset.

Anyway, I'm just getting this stuff off my chest since I don't want to keep burdening my husband with my crying and ranting. I know there's a lot of you out there going through similar or worse things. Just wanted to write out my frustrations as well 🤷‍♀️

TLDR I'm frustrated and depressed af seeing everyone hanging out now while still in the midst of this pandemic, and I seem to be the only one I know still isolating, and even though I wouldn't join in hangouts it makes me super bummed and upset to not even be invited or reached out to when I tried so hard in the past to be including of everyone, and I'm just so tired of being lonely and feeling forgotten.",88,0.98,jdu1in,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jdu1in/feels_like_im_the_last_person_isolated_out_of/,39,Support,2020-10-19,-19,160,-0.11875

So I was a confirmed case in March, as its been noted your sense of taste and smell can be altered.

Also any kind of meat smelled and tasted like straight oil, itpletely grossed me out and typically im a huge meat eater. I love steaks, burgers, wings, loin- all of it. My sense of taste has since recovered and im back to munching on my favorite foods but my sense of smell on some foods hasnt recovered- specifically eggs. They smell different now especially the yolk part, doesnt matter if hard boiled or poached and runny. I was wondering if anyone else was having similar side effects. Im starting to get concerned because my urine has the same smell as the eggs even if I dont eat any eggs for days at a time. Its overpowering, im not like stooping down to sniff it or anything weird like that. Its a difficult smell to describe kinda like turmeric and sulfer?

833,"Suddenly finding it hard to cope again I have no idea what is going on with me the last few days. Back in March I was having trouble adjusting and then a particularly bad period in late July/early August.

But for awhile after that I was okay. I was used to life at home and developed a routine. Things were good and even when they weren’t I could cope. 
But the last week or so I have fallen back down into a depression missing my “old life” before covid. I’ve been back to not wanting to eat or do much of anything but walk and lay in bed. I’ve been fighting back against it but I just don’t understand.

Throughout this whole time I always, ALWAYS, held onto..it’s gonna end someday soon. Yesterday for the first time I didn’t believe that anymore. I saw years of this ahead. I’m not sure what’s changed, maybe it’s from nicer weather so I want to get out or holidaysing up. I just want to be okay again.

I do go some places. Starbucks drive thru, visiting my sister (lives an hour away), occasionally Walgreens or similar, getting ice cream. I don’t do grocery shopping or church or any place packed with people. I miss it.

835,"Feeling tired and helpless The amount of anxiety this stupid virus gives me is unbearable right now and everything indicates it's going to get worse before it gets better.

I'm afraid of getting infected or getting others infected. I'm ever more afraid of being confined to my home again. I live alone in a small flat and the lockdown in March and April, being unable to see my friends and family, was unbearable. During the summer, the virus pretty much slowed down and everything seemed to be maybe not back to normal, but on its way there. I was hoping I will be able to work from the office again before the end of the year.

Not the virus is back with a vengeance, my country's pitiful healthcare system is already overwhelmed and the amount of new infections is mounting nearly every day. We're on ""soft lockdown"", which is pretty much a bunch of random lockdown measures slapped together to make it seem we're doing something about COVID-19. The risk of getting sick is now real and I can't mentally afford to sequester myself in my apartment and wait for the end of pandemics.

Everything is so tiring right now. Having a walk now means having a sheet of damp paper or cloth on my face and barely seeing anything through fogged glasses. I don't know why do I even bother, half of the people I see don't wear masks anyway or leave their noses uncovered. Cashiers in shops wear them on their chins.

Visiting anyone (right now only my parents, my brother and the same group of friends) makes me afraid I may be sick and possibly infecting them. I have a deviated septum, which routinely causes me rhinitis and sinus problems. It's a nightmare right now, because hoarseness or runny nose could be the first symptom of COVID-19. I check my temperature every day (in fact, every several hours). Last night, I was convinced I lost my sense of smell until it turned out I just worked myself into believing that. Anxiety-related disease symptoms were always a problem for me and the current situation is a perfect breeding ground.

The media is now unbearable, just a parade of sad and scary news. I turned Facebook notifications off, because it was pretty much more of the same. It's hard to block out every mention of the disease anyway and I feel unprepared if I don't read at least a bit. Then a bit bes a lot and I inevitably find some terrifying news: reinfections, crippling permanent effects, overworked medics, etc.

I miss the period of my life when even when it was crappy, I could hope it was at least going to be better. Now it's just waiting for the other shoe to drop. Will someone I know get sick and die? Will I get sick and die? Will there be another hard lockdown and am I going to spend a month or two in an empty apartment? Will there be Christmas, or am I going to spend them alone calling my family through Zoom like it was a sprint planning (""I can't hear you, can you hear me?"")?",25,0.96,jdn6ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jdn6ha/feeling_tired_and_helpless/,10,Trigger Warning,2020-10-19,-38,172,-0.22093023255813954
836,"Out of synch with my partner - different experiences of the crisis When this all began, my partner (with whom I own and share our apartment) were in a similar position - stuck at home, trying to get masks and necessary things that were suddenly in short supply, and trying to adjust and support each other. She had begun a new job as an architectural manager in January, but any actual in-person work was immediately stopped by the pandemic measures.

This went on for three months. She became lonely, because I had to work during the day at home and couldn't pay her so much attention, and because she gets bored easily.

Then, suddenly, the easing came, and since then she has been out of the house 12 hours a day, often with work cutting into the weekend. In professional terms, she has never been happier.

Me, I withered - suddenly I was alone practically all the time, and it took a great toll on me, until one day I woke up and realized how degenerated I had be, and began walking for 3-4 hours a day, and tending better to my mental health.

But it is still a huge imbalance. Of all the professions that were closed down by coronavirus, the building trade was actually hardly affected, because it has been the cash cow of influential politicians for...forever. So she has an extraordinary measure of travel and daily stimulation, conversation, etc. And I am left behind, trying not to drag her down.

So I still struggle to stay connected, or reconnect with my girlfriend. It haspletely changed the dynamic of the relationship.

837,"Living alone : surrounded by people What it says in the tin. I know I'm not alone in this experience but feeling very distanced from everyone, including myself at the moment.

I moved back in with my father during the summer to help care for my sister. Even though he's a trans/homophobic ass and I am a flaming pile of LGBT question marks, it didn't feel too isolating. Now she's gone to live with my mother, I've moved back in with roommates and the mental state has gone from relatively stable to dangerously damaged.

It should have been a great living arrangement since two of the roommates are close friends from university; one of which I'd lived with before. Spoiler alert : it has not been great. These friends are also sisters. I had a falling out with the one I'm closest with over some personal stuff but now she refuses to talk to me and both of them don't seem to give a damn about COVID. 

They have friends over frequently - though with a reassurance that it's the ""same people"" who just so happen to be health care workers and amazon shoppers. They're also convinced it's okay because any guests stay in the host's room and wear a mask inmon spaces (which doesn't actually happen) as if the unmasking in the room is okay. I have pre-existing conditions and am terrified of being infected. My pops got laid off so i don't have health insurance right now (everything in my area is out of network with my mother's coverage - just paid 40$ for a flu shot)

I'm very lucky to have a WFH job that pays pretty well so I'm home most of the time, only going out for groceries and other essentials or just to be outside and away from everything. I take the bus because free transit pass, plus it feels safer than being in a tiny car with aforementioned roommates. Besides that, I really don't interact with people. My circle of friends is very small, even tighter now that it's down two. It's exhausting to hear people that you were close with kekeing just one room over while you spend all day playing video games in a desperate attempt to erase reality. 

Am I an asshole for being frustrated that these roommates / friends don't seem to realize that they were my one opportunity to interact with people and not be afraid?

838,"I need help convincing my family to take things seriously. Some background: I just turned 20, I'm currently living at home since my university is doing all online classes and not letting anyone live on campus (with a few exceptions.) 

I live with my two parents and two younger siblings (both taking online classes.) Ever since moving back home I have rarely gone out. The issue is that I think my family members feel that they can just pick and choose what social distancing guidelines they follow. Some examples: 

My brother is a hockey player, we live in Illinois where the governor has put a hold on all contact sports including hockey. To get around this my brothers hockey league drives to Michigan (where its allowed) every other weekend in order to play. WTF? I don't understand how anyone can see this as acceptable. This just requires him to stay in hotels with other players and expose him to other states. 

My family also often has guests over, maybe like once a week. Usually they all stay outside so it doesn't bother me too much but there are a couple people that are allowed inside my house. My brothers girlfriend, grandma and cleaning lady. None of them wear masks when inside. I know its just a small number of people but it freaks me out.

Two days ago my brother got a cold so he went and got tested. Luckily the results came back negative but it was a big scare for me. Yesterday I got a sore throat so I'm thinking I have the same cold he did. This to me is what'spletely unacceptable. The fact that we got sick is clear evidence that our quarantine is not enough. Yet my family ispletely unfazed. It entirely luck that we haven't gotten sick. I really don't know how to get through to them that things need to be taken more seriously. 

I would leave, but most of my friends who I could stay with are on the west coast (where my university is.) So it would involve days of driving and risking exposure to myself and then the friends that would take me in.

When Iplain to anyone they just tell me that its stupid that I'm worrying. I'm young and healthy. I hate this response with unimaginable passion. I know that I would be fine, but I don't want to be someone who's contributed to the death of hundreds of thousands of people. I also don't want to risk long term lung and heart damage. I'm on my schools rowing team so even a small impact on my fitness could be the end of my career. 

I feel so enraged because I feel that I've given up so much. I've left all my friends, gave up part of my college experience, my summer internship was canceled.

For anyone who hasn't seen them, here are two excellent guides to healthy eating for COVID19 and for staying healthy in general:

[

[

Please bear in mind that while there has been a lot of talk of the role of micronutrients in the progression of COVID19, vitamin supplements are NOT a cure once infected and have limited value at any other times unless someone has been medically diagnosed as deficient; Vitamin D in particular can cause health problems if too much is taken. Eating a healthy diet that naturally contains all these micronutrients is a much better approach.

**Hygiene**

Check out these excellent resources for how to improve hygiene in everyday situations including your home: [

And lots of great tips on this blog: [

842,"18 days and Post COVID-19 Pneumonia still not going away. Why is that? What's the prognosis? What's a good online resource on it? My mother 54 had symptoms starting on October 1st. She was diagnosed with moderate severity of COVID-19. The pneumonia was considered to be in mild phase at 5th day on Chest X-ray and Chest CT Scan. The Chest X-ray on 14th day did not find any pneumonitis or pneumonia in the report but the doctor did say that as shown in shade there still is. 

Its 18th October here and although the rest of her symptoms (eg extreme sleepiness and weakness, aches, malaise, headache etc) has improved, two symptoms remain. She still has pneumonia (the doctor wrote it as Post COVID Pneumonia) and persistent low grade fever (98.5F to 99F orally while her usualy temperature is 97 to 97.5F). She still has some mild dryish cough. 

Now, we live in Bangladesh and doctors only give 5 minutes and don't answer your questions. Given how scary the disease is and the lack of information is only fueling our uncertainty, anxiety and stress. 

I have been looking online for a resource on post covid pneumonia but could not find any. I asked a previous question on one of the major symptoms: the persistent low grade fever, so here I am asking about the post covid pneumonia.

843,"Feeling betrayed My husband went to a party today. In an enclosed space and didn’t wear a mask. No one in attendance wore a mask. I feel betrayed because on multiple occasions leading up to this we talked about him attending was stipulated on him wearing a mask indoors. Halfway through the day today, he told me that his mask was “in his pocket”. This made me so upset and I nearly had a panic attack. Great, your pocket is protected, how about you put it on? He proceeded to tell me everyone there was “safe” and they all declared they “hadn’t seen anyone lately”. I have zero faith in this as cases are surging and people in my state have been letting their guards down for a while now. Also, I know for a fact that kids that were there get shuffled between parents, grandparents, and school. 

I’m left in a position to self isolate for the next 3 weeks (extra caution because I have two very serious underlying conditions). I feel so betrayed that he looked me in the eye, just last night, and promised me he would wear a mask the whole time unless explicitly outdoors. Now he’s mad at me for self isolating, sleeping in another room, and wearing a mask around the house. It just feels like hepletely disregarded his promise to me and went with the word of these other people. It feels like a punch in the gut. We have been married 5 years now. It seriously makes me question things on a bigger level. If I cannot trust him during a pandemic to keep me safe, when can I?

To deny our fucking social standards? To deny our fun days? To kill people? What did god (if he even exists) have in mind when doing this? All I've learned from this is that God either doesn't care, loves suffering, or he doesn't exist. I'm going for the latter, at this point. 

I'm so fucking pissed right now. Here's Pfizer and Oxford saying earlier ""Oh, well, we might get something in September!"". That doesn't happen. ""Oh, wait, late October!"". Now they're pushing back? Stop pushing this shit back! Approve it now! The further you push it back, the more people get infected and die and the longer we have to mask and distance. It's that fucking simple! I hate this shit! I hate all of it! Where the fuck was the plans of this being over during the summer? Or when everyone thought this was a 2-week ordeal back in March? Why the fuck wasn't this the case? What was the point in all of these businesses closing? Nothing? Did God want to punish these owners and their customers? 

This is so fucking old! I want this to be over! Where is it? Where the fuck is our old world? I hate seeing the ""cute"" little ads where it's like ""OMG I have a mask XD"". No, fuck you, give me a normal fucking ad for once.

I have no idea how I'm supposed to deal with my normal depression, seasonal depression, and my fucking covid depression all winter. The other 2 alone have already drove me insane this entire summer. I can't catch a break.

&#x200B;

I am pretty young at 25y.o. but I smoked for a couple years and switched to vaping to quit. I did quit in May 2019 but recently picked it up again because I got unyielding cravings from my anxiety. I got prescriptions (temporarily) in April + May for benzos but then easily got off it once my long-term anxiety medications took effect.

&#x200B;

For June, July, August, and September, I was mostly feeling fine. I was able to push the bad thoughts out but I don't think I ever really solved the main issue: my confidence in my own health. So now, with my family being a probable (but not confirmed as we haven't gotten our test results back) case, I am sent spiraling down the bad rabbit hole.

My health history:

Smoker for 6 years (2 years tobacco, 4 years vaping). I quit in 2019 but picked it up again because of anxiety coupled with cravings this past end of May/June. Overweight (BMI of 28) but have been walking daily at least 2-3 hours. 25 y.o. male. No other known health conditions aside from allergies and ADHD (treated with bilastine & dex).

&#x200B;

What are my chances of surviving covid if I get it? Am I high risk? I look at the numbers and it seems like it's great but I get this gnawing feeling that my smoking history, coupled with my weight is going to make this a hell of a battle toe out of it alive.

871,"I just saw a local ISO post for COVID, people meeting up to get COVID. Our only hospital is so overwhelmed my biopsy was delayed & people are meeting up tonight to get infected to get it out of the way? I have been trying to keep busy inside and have been cleaning out the garage. I had a bunch of stuff I wanted to donate. I looked at a local ISO forum to see if anyone was in need. Ie across a post of a person looking for COVID and the had plenty of responses of people wanting to meet up and give it to each other. These people live close to me.  I live rural landlocked and until a month ago our city was doing well. Then suddenly a nursing home outbreak and our one hospital got overwhelmed. The next closest hospital is over 250 miles away. I had a bunch of procedures I needed to have done, including a biopsy. My last one came back unknown (so they say 25-30% is is cancer). The hospital had to delay after the nursing home outbreaks but hoped maybe a month things would get back to normal. Now over 300 people are discussing the COVID meet and lick or cough or whatever they are doing to give it to each other. 

I only stayed in this place because my child is a senior and they worked so hard for years and are applying to dream colleges. The schools here have been fully open and normal. I had planned to move to a larger city but thought I could wait till my child graduated in May 2021. Since March I have been getting less care and have felt pretty sick some days, I have to help my mom who does not leave the house and have a new neighbor that sits on his loud motorcycle and reves it up for hours a day (and I live in one of the nicest subdivisions, it has been full or respectful professionals and retired people for years and I get the lucky new guy so I can't sleep, yes it is 2am, he is on his motorcycle sitting in the driveway and down the road people are meeting up to get COVID) . 

I feel trapped here. My husband has a job in which we could move at anytime but I hate to take my daughter out of school. I just am having a hard night. I can't believe over 300 people are wanting to get COVID and they know our hospital is pleading for help. We have nurses and doctor sin our neighborhood who look so overwhelmed .

Hell, we can't even travel domestically. They opened QLD to us, and two weeks later it shut again. I can't stand this instability of open/close/open/close. I hate that theres no end in sight, theres no light at the end of the tunnel. I genuinely feel as if this is going to be the next 5, 10, 20, who knows how many years.

I really was pro-lockdown when they tried to assure us that it was a short-term thing but now with all these professionalsing out, I feel like theres no point to all this, that if WHO says lockdowns are not the way to go, that they must be right and so I'm angry at politicians for ignoring their advice. I feel like I can't even remember my old life, thats how far it feels and how long this year has felt. I have chronic crippling anxiety and prior to covid travelling around the world and the whole process of planning and budgeting and all that literally would provide me with a sense of happiness and liveliness I can't even put into words.

I am looking into moving overseas either by working or studying but due to being unemployed I can't study, and countries right now aren't exactly prioritising foreigners over their own, which is totally fair.

Not her fault just thats what loneliness does to you disgusting...

My wife, has severe anxiety and has suffered from depression in the past, but being cooped up at home for so long is starting to really wear on here. We go on walks/hikes everyday, but that just isn't enough. She is terrified of COVID, so she will not see family or friends, or do anything. She could care less if she contracts COVID, but if the baby gets it, she would lose her mind.

I always wear my mask, however. For my whole shift at work, unless I am eating or drinking, I have my mask on.

881,"Feeling hopeless For context, I'm a 25 year old guy with Asperger's syndrome living in Ontario, Canada (nearby Toronto).

Since the lockdown began, I have been having episodes of feeling depressed and hopeless. During those episodes, either I get visibly upset, I shut downpletely, or sometimes both. I have had similar episodes while working at a call center for five months in 2017 before quitting, but this situation is far worse.

It has gotten to the point where I will never go out for any reason; if going out requires me to wear a mask, social distance and/or practice other measures, I'd rather not go out at all. It would be too depressing to see these measures being practiced and I am not the adaptive type.

I will not celebrate new years this year, and I don't think that it's even worth it to celebrate my birthday either. My birthday is in late November, and it is supposed to be my 26th.

The news is filled with nothing but negativity regarding the pandemic. Despite many requests, my parents, who I still live with, keep tuning in to the news regularly. They are also being fooled by the news into believing that the pandemic will end and things will go back to normal. I was planning on moving out within 2-3 years, but the pandemic threw a wrench at those plans.

My work allows me to work from home, but that does not help the situation. If the pandemic and its measures drag on to 2021 and beyond, which is possible given how behind Canada is with vaccinespared to other countries, I might as well be dead. Even if vaccines be available, I don't have any faith in life going back to normal.

I talk to a therapist, but I refuse to take any medications. I never believed in anti-depressants or similar drugs. I had always seen them as nothing but placebos. Hiking is also out of the question as I am no outdoorsman, I live in the suburbs and there are no hiking trails nearby where I live.

It has been seven months since the pandemic began, and I cannot go on any longer. There is no hope, and the pandemic will never end.

The one thing I needed to do the most to build my confidence and social skills (social anxiety, GAD and ASD) was get out of here and independent from my parents. That is exactly the one thing I can't do right now. In fact, she is the only person left that I can legally see (her and my stepdad) for the foreseeable future.

So I started working again in August, and since then, I've been pairing my facemask with a plastic faceshield.

However, since then, and increasingly so every day it seems, I get headaches while I'm wearing it and taking it off, even for a few seconds to adjust it, brings immediate relief. So it's definitely the shield.

My question is whether there is any evidence that face shields actually help outside of clinical settings. I'm an ABA therapist, so my job is going into people's homes to work with their kids, who often don't wear a mask, and we don't require it because of their disability.

I also work in an RSP classroom(currently virtually) and we might be going back to work physically soon, so that would mean an additional 8 hours of wearing a face shield for me, when we go back.

Is the face shield doing anything for me at all? Or is it just an extra headache that I'm giving myself for a false sense of security? I'll deal with the headaches and difort as long as it takes, if it is helping me, but I'd rather not wear it, if it is totally useless.

I've been so fatigued and brain-foggy lately I'd be scared it was a COVID symptom if it weren't for the fact that I've got depression/ADHD. The symptoms have been so much worse because I've spent so much time indoors and alone. Plus, I've had all of these fun and exciting new health issues pop up--vitamin D/B12/iron deficiencies, assorted unexplained symptoms that doctors can't quite place (I get to wear a heart monitor for a month! Exciting!), and a notoriously questionable immune system meaning I don't feelfortable studying or attending classes on campus.

I don't have the mental presence to focus on self-care right now, much less college. I feel like if I could just take some time to focus on taking care of myself and adjusting my meds again I'd feel better. My parents insist if I see this through to the end I'll feel proud of myself, or if I withdraw I should attempt to be fully financially independent because I'd feel better that way, but who's even hiring right now? Why would I feel better about dragging my exhausted body through to the end of a semester where I learn nothing?

I have been doing the right things. Wearing a mask and getting my distance. I know how bad COVID can be to someone and someone else if you get them sick.

892,"Social distancing sanity check I just need a sanity check on my actions up to this point.

Some context: Back around March, I started doing the social distancing thing. I'd occasionally see friends outside, who at the time I thought were being responsible. Then (in SC) our infection rates started to spike, so I cut back on in-person interactions. Our percent positive test rate hovered around 20% for a long time, and now we're at a consistent 10%. The governor has removed almost all Covid related restrictions at this point.

If my friends in the area acted responsibly, I'd like to visit them more often. However it's not umon for them to attend birthday parties, intramural recreation leagues, cookouts, restaurants, bars, etc. It seems most people, including them, have ""learned to live with it"".

So, I'm looking for a sanity check. Am I going overboard by refusing to participate in happy hours and birthday parties in the middle of a pandemic? If the social activity is outside, am I crazy for not participating, even though I know I would be the only one wearing a mask?

It feels like everyone has given up and I'm the last one holding out. This wouldn't bother me if I knew we were all in it together, but it truly feels like I'm alone in keeping up the good fight.",3,1,jbbkvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/jbbkvp/social_distancing_sanity_check/,6,Support,2020-10-15,0,77,0

While I don't advocate for easing at all especially as we get into fall and winter, it really ticks me off that we have these articles from CNN and the likes doomsday predicting that we're going to lose nearly 3,000 people a day by December because of pandemic fatigue just as we learned that the stimulus got rejected becuase neither side wants to make their opponents look good or give them a boast so that means that no stimulus or no relief means that people are going to get more fatigued. I mean it's so easy for these people in media to report on what could happen in the fall and winter because they have a home to go to, they can work at home and make money livingfortably while the rest of the public has just get by.

I work in local government for a small rural county in the Deep South. We have been lucky so far in that our number of cases and deaths are very low (although I worry that the number of cases is depressed because of a lack of willingness to get tested). However, our state has not been so lucky and we are just north of a major metropolitan area that has been devastated by the virus. 

My workplace has done almost nothing to protect its employees and relies on the “government exemption” as justification for not enacting blanket policies on staff. We interact with the public daily and I had to fight general services to get plexiglass installed at our service windows. We have to purchase hand sanitizer ourselves (it is not supplied for staff or the public), masks are not required (both in the office and at public meetings), staff members whoe in contact with confirmed or suspected cases are not required to quarantine, and teleworking policies have been eliminated for those without children. I am the only individual in my building that wears a mask all day. 

So far I have tried to stay out of other people’s business, but yesterday I overheard a staff member say that her husband was sick and not allowed on his job site and that they “gave it to half their family”. I’ve hit my breaking point. I haven’t seen my family in almost a year, my boyfriend lost his grandmother to COVID, and I see no end in sight.

I have some kind of mild health issue and when covid19 started spreading my doctor rmended me to not get close to anyone who is ill, but with covid anyone can have it and especially a school filled with people wasn’t the safest thing. My parents called school and managed to keep me at home at the beginning before the schools closed themselves. Somewhere in april/may they opened up again and people were going physically to school 2-3 times a week. In august I had an appointment with my doctor and oh man it was pathetic, he told me that I am safe to go to school and proceeded with asking me for a high five. On that same exact day I was supposed to draw blood and the women who was there was literally chewing gum right in my face while taking like 13 tubes. Fast forward through the holidays till the beginning of the next school year, schools arepletely open now and it is like it used to be before but with “safety measures” which basically means nothing because there has already been a decent amount of covid cases in my school. I am still not physically going to school but a few teachers set up “digital classes” but that is only a few. I am extremely behind with school work and it is extremely hard for me to keep up with it because school doesn’t do anything for me. It is just me and the internet, and hopefully I can be prepared for the exams.

901,"I Miss Being With My Friends I was born to neglectful parents, cold peers, and a distant older sister. My parents were to poor too spend a lot of time with me and when they were around they were cold and distant. I was ""gifted"", so I skipped 4 grades and was always younger than my classmates, which, along with my Asperger's, made it hard to connect with others. They also refused to be my friend, considering me too dull to spend time with.

I didn't really get a childhood. I never got to have sleepovers or play dates. So, in 2011, when I had gotten my own job and home, I made the choice to cope with my lost childhood for making it up then. Now, I am a 29-year-old woman who cuddles with teddy bears, watches cartoons like We Bare Bears, Steven Universe, and Adventure Time, jumps around on hopper balls and in bouncey houses, eats childish foods like chicken nuggets, candy, apple juice, and mac n' cheese, and still wears childish clothing like tutus, overalls, and lace-up boots.

I love it, and one of the reasons I love living like this is because I have wonderful friends who support me and do all this stuff with me, making up for the friends I never had as a real kid. But ever since COVID-19 entered our state, we've been adamant about abstaining from physical affection and time together so that we don't spread COVID-19 to the more vulnerable.

I miss being with my friends. I miss getting home from my job as an accountant and changing from pantyhose, a blazer, and heels into a floral sundress and black boots. I miss then getting together with my friends and hoping around on giant, inflated hopper balls, feeling our butts sink into and out of the rubber. I miss then feeling ome of them jump behind me and putting my hair in a ponytail, and then I do their makeup in exchange.

I miss stopping after 45 minutes to go shopping for hours on end, constantly hugging eachother out of nowhere. I miss thening home to gorge ourselves on candy and ice cream, while snuggling with eachother and our teddy bears while marathoning Steven Universe, We Bare Bears, and Adventure Time.

911,"Coming to you all with some cautious optimism about long term outlook! Hey! I know many of you are feeling anxious and uncertain about what the future holds especially with this pandemic going on. I recently made a post not too long ago where I dispelled some of themon myths going on around the internet about COVID citing studies. I thought it was time for an update. 

I've been following the science of COVID very closely, and for a good while the notion of COVID leaving you disabled or with lingering illness scared the ever-living crap out of me. It was made even worse when I got COVID since I am Hispanic and live with tons of essential workers.  I have OCD, so these thoughts became my new obsession. 

(DISCLAIMER I AM NOT DOWNPLAYING THE CORONAVIRUS. THIS IS A DEADLY VIRUS AND MUST BE TREATED AS SUCH. I HAVE LOST PEOPLE TO THIS VIRUS SO IT IS NOT A JOKE)

So let's see what the latest developments are in the science: 

There has not been any conclusive evidence for organ damage or the like within the 9 months that the pandemic has been going for. If nothing ising up now, then it's unlikely we will see more in 9 years. 

Did you know themon cold can cause heart inflammation? This is the one about themon cold causing myocarditis:[

And this is one study criticizing the flaws with the study that said 70 percent of covid positives have heart inflammation: [

 Imperial College London's Professor Darrel Francis (@profdfrancis, specialty is cardiology) has some excellent twitter threads on these types of topics from the time of the myocarditis papers in August (the ones that shut down Big 10 football). Ultimately without pre-COVID scans/MRIs/etc., you have no idea if what you're seeing is the result of COVID or the result of pre-existing phenomena caused by lifestyle factors (age, diet, exercise habits or lack thereof, smoking, drinking, etc.). 

Also here is one that shows lung function improvement in patients discharged with COVID: [

"" ""Radiological abnormalities in patients of severe COVID-19 could bepletely absorbed with no residual lung injury in more than two months’ follow-up."" Note that this study only looked at severe cases. Mild/asymptomatic cases are expected to do better. However, a separate study from the Lancet reported that subjective symptoms can linger after radiological changes have healed ""

However, I also acknowledge the long haulers, in which right now the prevailing theory is that it is some sort of POST VIRAL SYNDROME. We don't know much on this one quite yet, but at the very least it seems to be in a minority of patients (around 20 percent of positives) and usually improves in a couple of months to a couple of years. 

This is anecdotal so probably worthless, but my entire family got COVID. Of the people that survived, no one. Not even my grandma got lingering side effects from it. We all got checked afterward. But please if you do get covid get checked, you want to catch anything FAST.

When in doubt follow the science. I can't stress it enough to stay away from the media. Shamelessly plugging r/COVID19

I don't really post much on Reddit because of my social anxiety but here I am, because everything is just so much right now. I feel so lonely, all the time, every day, every week, I just wake up and do the same thing. My online classes in university are starting to pile up and everything is getting harder to deal with, and I just feel so alone through it all.

I feel bad about that, especially when I feel lonely and need someone to talk to because I feel like I'm being too clingy. It seems like no matter where I turn, I'm always destined to be alone. My best friend lives in a different city, so I can't see her, and she has a group of people that she talks to sometimes, and my boyfriend is busy with school and also has a group that he can talk to also. But I feel like I have no one else. My parents are both busy with their jobs, and my brother talks to his friends too. All I want are just real friends, true friends, just anybody I can talk to. I don't know how much longer I feel I can just take this loneliness. The last time I ever talked to anybody that wasn't my family, or just interacted with other people, I just felt so alive and so happy. But when I'm alone everything just crashes down on me, and I just feel so empty. I miss hanging out with people. I miss talking to people. I miss working with people. I miss studying with people.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I have all of my hobbies to keep myself occupied, but it doesn't seem to give me much joy anymore. I do all these things, but I want to share what I do with someone else. I just want to work with someone else, maybe write a story, orpose a song. I've just been keeping everything internally now that it's getting really frustrating, but I don't know where to go. I get really sad when I see that people close to me have a group of people they can talk to, or that they have a reliable support net. I feel like I'm just hanging on by a thread. I just crave that interaction so much, but I don't know what to do. I am so sick of calls and staying inside, I feel like I'm just wasting away. And I don't know if I can ever return to university. Even if I do, will I even make any true friends? I feel like I'm getting desperate at this point, so much so that I check my phone every single day for anything, *anybody* to talk to. It doesn't help that I can't even really go out.

Before this pandemic I was really social. I felt like things were getting better, that I was growing as a person. Now I feel like this pandemic took my social life away from me, something that I feel like I can never get back because it's so hard for me to talk to people and make real friends. Now I feel like I've regressed farther back than I've ever been before.

I'm really sorry if this is long, but this has been bothering me for such a long time now. Originally I was happy at the idea of staying inside and not having to socialize with anyone. The pandemic wasn't too bad for me at the beginning. But now I'm sick of it and losing my mind. I didn't know that I craved this much social interaction.",8,1,ja8392,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ja8392/so_much_to_deal_with_yet_so_alone/,4,Support,2020-10-13,-12,147,-0.08163265306122448
913,"I feel worthless I can't stand it anymore with my situation. As mentioned before, I've had issues with my toxic parent. It is almost impossible to avoid her. I'm the only one out of everyone including those in my circle of friends who works from home. She is well aware I work from home and that won't change for a very long time. I don't get paid enough but it's in my field. If I want to move up I need to work this job so I can have that mythical work experience thesepanies badly want. Since my two younger brother's work jobs that are not WFM, and my WFM job was very lax and laid back, she has to direct everything onto me. I've now been under furlough again due to the spikes of cases and I'm really scared toe out to my parents that I'm unemployed again. They'll just see me as lazy and good for nothing because now instead of me being shut in my room, I have to hear how I'm a jobless loser and them telling me to get a job over and over and over and over and over. Then hear them rmend me the dead end stuff like grocery stores and Amazon that the news gets paid to report over and over and over and over and over. I got my degree not to put what I want to do on the backburner. I don't want to go do those COVID heavy slave mills and get the virus, get locked in my room for a month and possibly die of it. All these jobs are so lousy I make more off state unemployment than if I were to work for them since they tend to chop hours where you only make 200-300 bi-weekly since like you know, EVERYONE needs a job now. Since I barely leave the house, I have to hear her call me down every single minute and I have to stop whatever I'm doing just to placate her by doing a chore or housework that she can do in literally 1-2 minutes herself. I really honest to god want to move out so bad but I have to wait. I snapped to a point where I squatted in an apartment for a couple days. (Was a friend who moved out of it but still was under lease.) just to get away from her. I just can't take it anymore. I feel this virus is just an excuse for me to be the laziest person on the planet and they all think I'm enjoying every minute of this due to my penchant for video games. I used to game less and less due to other things in the way and now of course I game more, but only because there's only so much do to when being in a place of people puts you at risk for killing you or others. All my friends are aware of this and can't leave their homes either. 

&#x200B;

Me using the virus where I am is an excuse isn't it? Then again I think everything I'm making is an excuse. If I have to die and get sick just to be left alone and not be constantly shamed by them then I might as well get sick and lose everything again so be it. I'm willing to give up my dreams and ambitions to show I'm not a lazy NEET loser to them. I lost it once already in March after losing my chance at a job. (COVID shutdown happened shortly after my interview and was told I didn't get the job due to the shutdown.)

914,"No one at my job wears masks Hey guys I'm just looking for some support. At my job there is no way to stay distanced from each other as it is a small building and everyone has to be close to each other to do our job. Yet no one wears masks unless they're around customers. Their thinking is that if one of the employees gets it then we're all getting it. I think this is a very stupid reason to not wear a mask. It's like they don't care about me or each other. 

How do I explain to them that we can still try and prevent it by wearing masks? I've talked to my supervisor about it and she sent out an email reminding them to wear masks but they still don't. My supervisor is on vacation this whole week so its not like she can enforce it anyway. 

I'm scared of getting it and I wear my mask the entire time I'm at work and I also wear gloves. This blatant disregard they're showing pisses me off. I don't want to start telling everyone to wear masks though because I don't want them to hate me and I also don't think they'll listen anyway because I'm not a supervisor or anything.

915,"Strangers in my house... This morning, the person I live with was showering and I began to hear water pouring down into the wall and leaking beneath the baseboard into my bedroom. Awesome, right?

I got the water cleaned up and the leak stopped when we turned the shower off, but it's safe to assume a pipe is broken, and neither of us are qualified or experienced in plumbing enough to fix this ourselves. So, plumber it is.

This will be the second time we've had to have someone in the house to fix a plumbing problem in the past month (just lucky I guess,) but this time they'll be here a lot longer because they have to cut a hole in the wall and replace piping. In my bedroom. 

I'm scared to death of exposure. The recent news of cases spiking in certain states has really put the fear back in me, and I have no proof that I actually already had the virus back in May. Does anyone have any tips for how to deal with repairs that absolutely have to happen? Should I avoid my bedroom like the plague (literally) for a certain amount of time while they're here? Wear a mask? Disinfect until my hands are bleeding (again?)

Update: Well, they didn't have to break the wall open and the repair didn't cost an arm and a leg. So I'm grateful for that.

Over the weekend I started feeling really depressed and bad thoughts were entering my head. Today things started getting better...and then it fell apart again. I have one friend who might need gallbladder surgery and another friend who is being admitted to the hospital tonight for issues not covid related.

So the situation is that I live in a house with 4 other people, 2 of which work from home, although my stepdad also works at aic book store in person 4/7 days.

924,"26 yo, ""Morbidly"" obese with no other known health issues, panicking because I feel I got exposed to COVID Help. I am panicking over here.   
Went out on Saturday for the first time in months to meet two friends at a park. We were all wearing face masks (I was wearing two actually) and sun glasses, and distancing. Although the distance was mostly 1m, so not ideal. And one of my friends was wearing a face mask that kind of loose.

My friends were supposed to have been quarantining themselves too, but once we started talking turns out they had seen other people this same week and one had gone to the dentist. I felt a bit betrayed because those were not the initial conditions upon which we had agreed our meeting...

Apart from that, the park was quite full and when we tried to take a stroll we ended up being quite near some people. It was a short while and we didn't stay in place, but I feel like we got exposed anyway.

I am 29 and ""morbidly obese"", with a BMI of 54 right now. Have always been obese but in perfect good health. In February all my bloodwork was A+ even though I was already technically ""morbidly obese"". Same for other health studies such as ECG and circulation. However, with the pandemic and not going outside I let myself go and gained like 20kg since March... I have been eating really badly and not exercising. When I went out on Saturday I had to walk 3.9 km to get to the park and another to get back, and I got really tired.

There are around 700 new cases every day in my city and 75 deaths. I feel so dumb now for having gone out. I just missed seeing people and going to parks, since it's already spring.

I am a bit psychosomatic, and now I keel feeling as though my ears hurt and I already got phlegm in my throat. I am really really scared of getting COVID and having a serious condition. 

I don't want to die :( And I am also afraid for my family if something were to happen to me. I am a single child and my parents are at high risk too. 

Any tips for reducing my anxiety? Apart from trying to eat more healthily and start exercising?

926,"I feel like the pandemic has stolen my life from me. Honestly, I really just need a place to vent and hear some support from others. I'm really struggling with the reality of the virus. I feel like it'se at the worst point in my life - I'm in my first year of university which has always been sold to me as one of the best points in your life. Already, I missed my last year of school and had to choose the option of going to uni or taking a gap year. I chose uni because I really wanted out of my hometown, travelling is difficult and it's very difficult to find a job anymore. I felt like if I managed to get a 9-5 job I would be taking it away from someone who actually needed it as mine would just be to fill up time.

In all seriousness, I've had a good time so far, my flatmates are the loveliest people and we have a lot of fun together, the online schooling is of a surprisingly high quality, but I'm still really struggling. I've got COVID right now so I'm isolating, but I also have to deal with the uncertainty that I could have to go into a longer lockdown at any point. The anxiety I feel at that prospect is really too much. I have on-campus hours at uni and society/sports eventsing up but I've not been able to attend any of them due to my isolation and I'm so scared that I may never will because of the rising cases. It really is the uncertainty that frustrates me the most, you never know what will happen each week because the situation is never stable. Coupled with the fact that I'm living in apletely different city and I can't go home anymore, it's too much for me. I've been quite good at trying to manage my emotions but today I've hit my lowest point and I just can't stop crying.

I know I'm in a very privileged position inparison to others. I have no worries of survival and I have a support network so I've been trying so, so hard to stay as positive as possible. But it's really difficult at the moment with isolation and I'm questioning ifing to uni this year was the right decision after all.

I'm really scared of going back to that place, yet even then at points I still, at times, genuinely had hope of a happier, more exciting future.

We're both higher risk & living in a big covid hotspot city, but he doesn't take a lot of the same measures I do. And to be honest, he's probably more high risk than me. But he goes out on weekends to friends houses, no distancing or masks whatsoever, and I only ever see my friends if we're outside, 6 feet apart and we're masked. I'm not friends with my roommate, so I can avoid him mostly, but we still have to share the same spaces. I turned part of my room into a mini makeshift kitchen for this reason but I still need the regular kitchen for the microwave & freezer, and we have to share one bathroom. He works from home but he took over the living room as his workspace and he's always talking loudly on zoom calls - I'm just thinking of all the breath particles flying from his mouth and getting all over the apartment, especially once it gets too cold to leave the windows open for ventilation.

I just overheard him talking that he's visiting home for the holidays by plane, and it just gets me even more worried. I've chosen not to visit home and it sucks and I'm so fucking sad, but I think the holidays this year are going to be terrible super spreader events, and I would never do that to my family or to myself. I'd rather wait for the vaccine. But he won't, and I'm terrified he's going to bring whatever he's potentially exposed to right back to this apartment. I can't tell him what to do obviously and I don't want to be an asshole, but how do I protect myself from someone who is apathetic?

Also, anyone else stuck living with someone they really really don't gel with during this time? He isn't a horrible person by any means, but I still had issues with him before this all started.

931,"Struggling with how to deal with COVID anxiety + seeing boyfriend Feeling a wave of anxiety recently 

My boyfriend and I (both in our 20s) have been seeing each other seriously for over a year. I live with my family, none of whom are at particularly high risk though my parents are in their late 50s. My boyfriend lives with two roommates, who are quite cautious. My boyfriend also sometimes visits a few family members from different households, who as far as I know are quite concerned about COVID and cautious (though one is going to school right now). Otherwise, my boyfriend is quite cautious but overall less worried than I am - I have been quite anxious about COVID this whole time.

We weren’t seeing each other in person for the first 2-3 months of the pandemic, which was really hard. We then carefully started seeing each other. Recently, in anticipation of how long this would go on, we tried to make sure our visits would be regular. He expressed how lonely he had been when we didn’t see each other, and how stressful it was when it was difficult to arrange times to meet.

We recently had an upsurge in cases where we live, and after the past two weeks, I became really anxious and expressed this to him. I expressed that continuing to see him made me feel like I was doing the wrong thing with regards to potentially exposing my family, but that I valued our relationship and the impact of us not seeing each other. He listened and affirmed that we are in this together. Later that week, he saw a friend outside on a patio, and then went to see 4 family members, from different homes. Our government had asked people not to visit their families this weekend (Thanksgiving), but I know that he sees 3/4 of these family members semi-regularly, and so it falls quite in line with his usual behaviour.

I don’t know what to do. It made me feel really stressed that he was doing these things, but I also realize that those were understandable and notpletely irresponsible choices to make. I feel constantly aware that - as I’m living with my family - I always havepany and can always see my family loved-ones. I also realize that between us we didn’t have rules, so he didn’t “go against” my wishes. He did ask what I feltfortable with earlier, when we started seeing each other physically again, and we haven’t adjusted our expectations since. And it also feels as though my anxiety went way up very recently - not entirely unreasonably because of the rising cases - so I may not have reacted like this at another time.

But what now? Testing has be limited where we are, and I don’t know how “reasonable” my recent difort is. It feels like I’m being hard on him or punishing him. I think maybe this just needs to serve as another jumping off point for a chat about COVID and boundaries, especially considering the winter months. But I also feel like the answer won’t change that much - his family is important to him, and he’s expressed before that he can’t just stop seeing them. And in the grand scheme of things, I totally get that, and don’t want to prevent him from seeing them. I guess it just feels like when I get this stressed, it feels like our relationship is the non-essential element in the equation, the thing I shouldn’t be doing. But it *is* an important and serious relationship.

I’m not really sure what I’m asking or what I want to hear. I mean, I want to hear that the risk is small and I can keep seeing him without feeling anxious. But maybe I just also want to hear that other people are finding it really hard to balance seeing their partner with protecting family? Some days the risk feels so close and some days it seems so far - it’s hard to feel solid and like my decisions are from good risk calculations. And I think I need tomunicate more with him but it’s hard to think through what I would even ask him to do to make me feel les anxious… kinda venting but also very curious about any thoughts.

932,"Bf's band tour starts this Wednesday... Hello. I don't know if you guys can help me. My boyfriend is in a band and the leader had no better idea than to plan a tour in the middle of all this. I am pretty concerned because the tour that is supposed to start this Wednesday is more than 2 weeks long through different European countries. I was reading the recent restrictions for each country we are planning to visit and it looks like some places where we are planning to go are cancelling indoors musical events, for example Czech Republic even though the event is still up in Facebook and the establishment hasn't made anyment about it being cancelled. I am not really sure about restrictions in Italy or France because I can't find the information in their websites. I also went to check what the other band we tour with says and I am in shock, they say the tour is still happening and they will fight against for the freedom and against the big mistakes the government is making with these rules and they will organize clandestine shows if they need to.

I am so sad that I need to travel with this people. 

I lost my grandfather one week ago and my grandmother still in hospital cause of this virus and seeing these idiots not caring about anything makes me so angry, also my boyfriend only tells me ""he can't do anything"".

933,"dangerously close to ending my life right now, what do i do? i wrote here before but recently i lost the job that i hated and this became the last drop. also, the perspective of another quarantine is clearer each day which means that

- i will NOT find a job in these circumstances due to the collapsed economy

- i recently read the news about possible devaluation of my country's currency and it means that my money i've been saving since 2017 will turn to dust which means i'm gonna eat my own shit for at least a decade

i chose the date, i chose the method, and making such decisions is actually really scary and isolating. my parents tell me i'm selfish - but isn't it selfish to ask a person not to die knowing they've been feeling like shit for months and it's not only not gonna improve but it will get worse and worse? i really don't want to feel this amount of pain anymore. my sleep regime ispletely fucked up, i can't eat, i don't have energy for cleaning my apartment even though it's turned very gross, i started having panic attacks every day again, i live in moderate to severe derealization most of the time, i just can't let go of the fact that i will never get my old life back and nothing will ever be at least fine. i tried hotlines, they don't work. i tried therapy but it's gonna take YEARS to recover with my problems and i feel terrible right now and i need to fix it as soon as possible because living like that is unbearable. therapy and meds are useless when you have real reasons to end your life. call me weak, i know i am, i'm just really tired and i want to sleep forever. anyway, there's no difference between life and death at this point: you'll get nothing in both cases but if you're dead, you won't feel anything about it, and i'm tired of feeling in general. i had suicidal thoughts before but this time i'm the closest to actually doing something dangerous. i don't want hospitalization for many reasons, mostly because it will just delay my death and not convince me that life is worth living. are there any fast ways to improve your mental health condition immediately, at least to the degree of suffering less?",76,0.93,j90bru,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j90bru/dangerously_close_to_ending_my_life_right_now/,75,Trigger Warning,2020-10-11,-22,123,-0.17886178861788618
934,"WEEKLY UPDATE STICKY: 11-18 October 2020 **Concerns over news about airborne and aerosolised transmission**

There have been a number of posts this week expressing concern over news reports that seem to have suggested CDC changed its guidance to say SARS-Cov2 is now airborne. This is not the case - the official, and correct page, is here:

[

Essentially, nothing has really changed about how the virus is suspected and then known to spread since the very earliest days of the pandemic - it was always clear that SARS-Cov2 was not truly 'airborne' - a term reserved in public health for a few diseases including chickenpox and measles, that can truly linger in the air and so are highly contagious - but it was suspected that it may be possible in certain conditions for it to be 'aerosolised' which, also in certain conditions, does present a slightly increased risk. All the latest evidence has done has confirmed what has been assumed for months. This does not mean SARS-Cov2 lingers in the air for hours in normal conditions where there is adequate ventilation, and particularly that it does not linger in the air outdoors. 

Unfortunately, a draft version of the updated CDC page, using language that was easily misinterpreted by journalists who have little background in science and their eye on a sensational headline, was briefly put up online before it was realised that the wording used wasn't the most accessible to non-experts, and it was removed and reworded. The correct version is linked to above. Typically, not all of the news agencies that had jumped on the sensational 'news' that it was now 'airborne' bothered to correct their mistake and have left a lot of people feeling nervous and anxious. Good coverage of the erroneous draft going up and then being corrected can be found here: [ and here: [

Please don't say the virus is airborne in posts orments on this site - any that are likely to increase anxiety will be removed.

935,"How would you stay safe? My son plays hockey and recently resumed the season after the club worked to bring everyone back safely. The typical safety guidelines are in place - everyone has to wear masks, distance, and only one parent/guardian is allowed in the facility per child.  The older players who are already inpetitive play can't have any spectators at all. My husband and I switch off on hockey duty so we can each get a chance to watch our son practice and play. 

The club has sent out numerous reminders about the guidelines but you still have people trying to skirt the rules. I heard of one instance in which a parent went off on a volunteer doing check ins, to the point police were called. They said they want to start publishing names of offenders. 

My issue is with one family who for weeks has beening with extra people and do not wear masks inside the facility. I hit my boiling point when I overheard them bragging to each other yesterday about not wearing masks and how all the parents look at them. 

We have brought this up and although those in charge are trying their best, they are hesitant to confront because they don't want altercations, arguments etc. I myself have tried to help but I'm one person and frankly don't feel like getting yelled at or worse. But I'm also having a hard time just standing by while people actively brag about it. Its to the point where we have been warned they may have to pause/shut down if things get worse since we're also having an issue with COVID cases going up locally. I want my child to keep going, have fun etc as we have just returned to some form of routine. And most importantly I want him, his peers and their families to stay safe. 

I dont want to get into the whole mask debate. The league sent out its rules and I'm happy to abide so my child can participate. I'm sure other organizations are dealing with these types of issues as well. But as they says its the few that can ruin it for the many.

Life right now is so painful, it’s monotonous, dystopian, boring and depressing.. my high school wouldn’t let me take a 5th year so I’m out of school. Never going to see it again because Covid ripped my last school year away from me.

I don’t feel safe getting a job considering cases in Canada are skyrocketing right now..

And if my plans to sign up for college go through, I’ll be doing it online because Covid will have ripped my college years away too.

I agree with the lockdown- our cases were out of control.

938,"I’m worried about my future because of COVID. I’m a 23 year old male who lives in a small college town in the Midwest of 17,000 people and I’m currently worried that my future is up in the air. Just so everyone here knows, I’ve been on the Autism Spectrum since I was 2 years old. But I’m mildly autistic however and several of my social skills have improved since I was diagnosed. Now I’m worried if this pandemic might’ve cost my chances to get a full time job, date someone, get married, raise a family and everything else of what I was hoping for in my life.

Before the pandemic, I’ve graduated from amunity college with a diploma in Welding Technology in August 2019, and I’ve been working part time as a dishwasher ever since. My part time job was supposed to be temporary, and I was going to have a job fair thising March to be about to find my first welding or any job that requires welding to be done. But then COVID hit, and the job fair got cancelled because of this.

I’m also worried on how this will affect my dating life once this pandemic is all over. I’ve never really dated very much even when I was in college, but since I’ve moved back to my area I was hoping to improve my dating skills. I did a little and I was planning on asking some girls that I’ve met at my town’s college too until the lockdown happened.

Since these the lockdown from this spring, I’ve down indoor workouts, and had read books on how I can improve my dating/relationship skills, and my networking skills for jobs too. I also part of a Christian group at my town’s college. They’re still allowing gatherings, but they have strictly required the members to wear masks when they gather together in small groups. I’ve also applied for two jobs recently. One for a landscaping position and one for a metal recyclingpany today. I’m thinking maybe trying to be either a electrician, plumber, carpenter, or landscaper if welding doesn’t work out as a career for me. I’m also still working my part time job and have been wearing a masks to work. I even moved into my first apartment almost 2 months ago. I’m also on SSI and SSDI at the moment. 

Even though I’ve been improving myself for the past 7 months, I still feel like the future is bleak for me. Some great advice on how I shouldn’t worry about myself after the pandemic will be great.

953,"I Just Want This All to Be Over I saw an interview with Anthony Fauci by a journalist at the New Yorker (his name escapes me at the moment, I'm very sorry) where Fauci reflected on his time dealing with the AIDS crisis in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. At the end, the journalist asked him to give a reasonable timeline for when social distancing can be dropped.

He said that in a month or so, we can begin a slow transition to normality, that will likely conclude in the fourth quarter of 2021. Why?? I miss my old life so much. I miss hugging my friends. I miss impulsively browsing shops with them for hours. I miss snuggling with eachother separated only by giant teddy bears watching Steven Universe, We Bare Bears, and Adventure Time.

I see people saying work should always be digital, and it scares and frustrates me. I love in-person work. I love pretending to be a dull accountant lady at work and then transforming into a convivial girly tutu-twirler when Ie home. I miss sitting in my office helping people with their finances. I don't care if mypany doesn't *need* an in-person office. I want one.

Last month, Robert Redfield of the CDC said we'd be back to normal in mid-June of 2021. What should I believe?

959,"Waiting on results, scared for wife's pregnancy Throwaway because.. personal stuff.

I started to feel a little under the weather this past weekend, like I was getting a cold which is isn't super abnormal for me. Or allergies, which is also normal. I decided to give it a couple of days to see if it went away and I started taking some allergy medicine in case it was seasonal allergies, due to the seasons changing. I took my temperature several times a day for several days and realized my thermometer is crap. I'd take it 2-3 times within 5 minutes and got different numbers, one minute it'd be 96, another it'd be 99.7, etc. Completely unreliable. On top of that my chest has been feeling tight and breathing a little shallow when I'm not focusing on it, but thats not unheard for me either, especially if I'm feeling particularly anxious, which I am and Google says that allergies can cause that as well.

I went ahead and scheduled a video visit with my doctor just to be safe and he ordered a COVID-19 test for me, which I had done today. So I'm thinking ok, my state's positivity rate is hovering at around 3% so even when taking the test is justified I'm still not very likely to test positive. I wear a mask everywhere and only go out for groceries or other essentials. And then I learn that if the virus has progressed into your lungs, a nasal swab might be negative but the virus could still be in your lungs, messing you up. So I feel like I can't even trust this test.

I'm the kind of person that when I feel something weird with my body, I google it, and end up on WebMD or something similar thinking I have 6 months left to live.. then Ie to my senses and realize its probably nothing and move on and the weirdness goes away and I'm fine. Sometimes I feel like my mind plays tricks on me as well, like feeling stuff that isn't really there just because I'm afraid it is there.

To top it all off, my wife is due to have a baby in a little over 2 weeks. If either of us end up in quarantine when the babyes we will be isolated from the newborn until the doctors believe it is safe for us to hold it. I can't even imagine how hard that would be, granted if I do have it, it should run its course by then, unless it bes serious (which with a BMI of around 42 it could, even though I'm in my early 30's).

I'm just scared, and can't do anything about it. The not knowing specifically is brutal. Even if I test negative, I don't know how much I can trust it. I'm scheduled to take another test at an urgent-care tomorrow morning because I wanted to reduce the chances of a false positive, but if the virus has already moved to my lungs then it'll still be a false negative anyway!!

Basically, I'm stressed out that the bottle has germs on it now, and is spreading those germs to the entire sink and bar of soap I use. In general, I just get really stressed out with the notion of ""object to object"" transfers with germs. Can COVID move from one object to another? Can there be ample amounts of COVID Germs on the floor? How far can germs travel once they are on a surface?

But now that's gone. I failed basically all my classes last semester and had to do a full year online instead of a half year like I was going to originally. And it sucks. I have no motivation to watch any of the lectures. I zone out during zoom seminars. I don't do readings and half ass my assignments. Thats how I feel about everything in life. Everythings terrible.

964,"I just lost my job because of Covid I worked for a small business. The owner was lovely, the managers were fantastic, and I loved all my coworkers. I truly loved the job. When the pandemic hit, I have to admit, I didn't think they would survive. I was surprised when they gave me a call to tell me they were reopening. That was 4 months ago today. I was happy, though. I was happy with my employment for the first time since I had started working at 16 (4 years ago).

My job decided to put all of their stores on a half price sale. That was on Saturday. By Wednesday I had a text saying I was out of a job as of October 15th. Aside from my Covid-related fears, this job was the main reason why I stayed here, and I feel cheated just like most people do right now.

I'm in Ontario but I was accepted into a university in Montreal. It's my dream school and I was absolutely elated. I got the news of the acceptance in March, actually the day that Canada went from 0 to 100 with their restrictions (March 13). It was this bit of amazing news during the beginning of a very dark and lonely time for all of us. I really wanted to move there this year but my good friend, the person I was going to move in with, is immunpromised. I'm also quite nervous about Covid, and there was no way I was going to put my friend at risk. Our university was one of the first in Canada to decide to gopletely online for their fall semester and we both very quickly decided it was best to stay where we are. We had housing and job security here, and for anyone who doesn't know, Montreal is currently the worst hit place in all of Canada for Covid cases. We decided not to risk it.

This has really taken a hit to my happiness. I'm luckier than most people though, because my entire tuition and then an extra few thousand dollars was given to me for my education this year in a mix of loans and grants from the government, and another grant for entering the program with high grades. If I budget I should be fine for at least a couple of months, maybe the rest of the year. Money isn't the issue here. It's the fact that I loved this job so much and now I have to go through the effort of trying to find a new one during a pandemic, when this was the first job that actually respected me and gave me what I asked for in terms of hours (it's hard to get hired in my city, and the places that actually do hire people refuse to give you more than 10-15 hours a week). I finally found a good one and now it has been ripped away from me.

I also feel like I don't have a right to be upset about this because I know there are so many people around the world struggling so much more than I am. People are struggling to put food on the table and here I am, sad that I lost a job I enjoyed.

965,"New city, new university, no socialising Hi,

I'm actually not sure how to start. Basically I finished university during lockdown and now started grad school. I developed anxiety in October last year - so before covid. It got a lot better after I started taking medication but now that I started my postgraduate course in a new city I have basically been stuck in my room (dorms) all the time. I don't know anyone here, my flatmates are unsociable and the university keeps organising online events which are useless, because it's not the same thing and people barely attend them. My highlight during the day is going to the supermarket. I just feel tired of it and kind of angry as well. Like don't get me wrong, I understand the need for restrictions (I'm a scientist) but I just feel like there's no end to it. It started with being 3 weeks back in March, then they kept renewing the restrictions for months and almost as soon as they slightly eased the restrictions we had are being threatened with new lockdowns. The university is sending us emails every few days, alternating between thanking us for following the guidelines and pretending to offer us support (there is barely any available) and threatening to expel us if we ignore restrictions. Classes are all online (""temporarily"" of course). My anxiety is skyrocketing at this point because I feel like I need in person social interaction. And the worst thing is knowing that there isn't anything I can do about it, even if I wanted to ignore restrictions there is no way I can just go and meet new people, because there are no parties or events going on. I don't really know what kind of advice I am looking for, because you can't just tell me to go organise a party (which I'd usually do if I wanted to meet people). There's no solution to it and it's the worst thing ever.
And I'm sorry if I am being egoistic to only think about myself now. I feel sorry for everyone who's been affected by it and I've been trying to do my best to keep myself and others safe for months, although I may have had it back in March when tests weren't widely available, but I need to look after my mental health too and try to stay sane.",9,1,j7ti9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j7ti9j/new_city_new_university_no_socialising/,2,Support,2020-10-09,-9,102,-0.08823529411764706

967,"Work/Lockdown have broken me - start of new beginnings Hi all,

Unfortunately work in the context of the lockdown has finally worn me down, to the point where I am going to resign from my job without having another to go to.

I was diagnosed with ADHD at the start of the pandemic when it becamepulsory to wfh. I was struggling with concentration, procrastination efficiency etc. also as my routine hadpletely changed, no longer exercising on my ride to work and no barrier from work or home it was the beginning of the end.

Then along came June, which is our busiest time of the year. I would have worked 80 days straight, averaging 12-14 days per day.

Normal years I would do this and then take time off detox/unwind. This year however with everything locked down I wasn’t able to do that.

Fast forward to now. Work is back to normal levels (40 hours per week). I however am suffering serious burnout with associated anxiety, inability to sleep, irritability, irrational anger, self sabotaging behaviours.

My interactions with work are when I am at my best, but they do not see iceberg of burnout under the surface.

It has finally got to the point where I have seen a doctor and I have been given some days off. For better or worse I have decided that I have to resign.

I am in a well paid job ($120k) so I realise the absolute stupidity in resigning right now however I really can’t hold on any longer without serious consequence.

I am relatively confident of getting a job even in a depleted market, but I am also going to use this time to throw myself into an online business.

I have savings to see me out until minimum early next year but probably longer. I also have recently purchased a property and have my first child on the way next year.

I feel liberated and empowered with my decision as it seems to be the only thing I currently have control over.

I’m not looking for support per se, as I am at peace with my decision and honestly it feels like whatever issue I could have getting a job is not worse than how I feel right now.

I have a supporting partner with openmunication and a plan of how I will move forward.

968,"New restrictions in my country and city, and I feel so depressed Hello everyone,

I'm from Belgium, The french-speaking part, but I live in Brussels. I'vee to this group since, just like many people, I often have ups and downs due to Covid-19 and everything that is going on. I hope you'll forgive my English mistakes as English is not my first language.

So, Belgium has basically been one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, I would say along with the UK, Spain and France (without counting Italy that is doing good right now). After things got more or less back to normal in June, we are experiencing a second wave since September with very high number of casespared to our population (11.5 million inhabitants, and we almost reach 3000 new cases a day). I study in Brussels and I'm also doing my internship there. A few weeks ago the government loosened the rules despite a high contagion rate, so as to ""provoke adhesion"", in the Swedish way, but the numbers kept going up. Yesterday, the government tightened the rules: only 4 people will be allowed to gather outside and inside, with bars only allowed to serve table of four. Bars now close at 11PM nationwise. I was already feeling upset at that time. Today, the government of Brussels, the most affected area in the country, where I live, went even further: all bars are closing in Brussels for one month + the rule of 4. So basically social life is almost over, again. The reasons behind it : some hospitals in Brussels are starting to feel pressure and there are serious signs that they might not be able to operate properly, so this seems legit.

Honestly, every time there are new rules, I feel shattered. I know I'm privileged: I'm from the middle-class, my student job is online, my internship is still taking place etc... but I am so tired of it, mixed with a feeling of anxiety and anger. I'm angry at many of my fellow young people who kiss each other and prioritize partying over being cautious, I'm angry at the government for the mix messages. I have the feeling we'll never get out of this. Belgium is so densely populated and many people prefer not to change their habits. Honestly, although I'm young, I have done quite a lot of effort to adapt to a ""new normal"" but I feel it's so pointless.

The most difficult thing for me is that I am this point of my life where my life would actually be great without covid. I'm in my last year of study, I am following an internship that I like. I found a great flat with great roommates (which hadn't happened to me before). I have plans and I am saving money thanks to small student jobs. Now, the internship I'm doing is for a festival that takes place in a few months and is now likely to be canceled... so that's discouraging as well. Every plans that I think of have to be reconsidered and possibly canceled because of Covid. I love meeting people and seeing my friends as well but I can't really do that anymore.

It honestly feels worse than the ""lockdown"" we had in March. Going backward makes me feel terrible. Today I thought I would like to go abroad for a month (I love travelling) in a place that is either relatively covid free or that seems to have loose restrictions and good numbers (like Sweden rn for instance) but I can't, and it's just unrealistic. Even if I go back to my home city, this wouldn't change much because my home city is also turning into a coronavirus hotspot and risks suffering from the same restrictions than Brussels.

I just came here to have some supports. Possibly ideas to help coping with this. I know I will feel better  soon and that life is not over. But I needed to share this with strangers who may feel the same as I do. Sometimes I feel better when I think that so many people are going through the same thing at the same time in spite of living in totally different countries. I sincerely hope a good vaccine will be available soon.

(BTW :  I am also totally aware that things could be worse and that I am a privileged person who has lost so little in this crisis. Also some of my close relatives tested positive but they both had very mild symptoms and quickly recovered, so nothing to worry about. ).

**Can it be safe for my mom to host her right after another plane trip though? If so, what precautions need to be taken? Any advice from people who travel/know more about the virus than I do?**

I think the other thing contributing to my nerves (and this feels terrible to say) is I don't really trust my aunt/themunication in my family. My aunt is amazing (as is my mom), but my family has major issues withmunicating and sticking to boundaries. I'm wondering, even with precautions to follow (whether on the plane or while at my mom's house), if they'll stick to them or be as aware as they need to be. (And I get it, this is hard for all of us, and why I haven't been putting myself in social situations. It's hard to follow protocols when you're with people you love.)

My mom is one of my best friends in the world. She lives alone, and I get that she's lonely, and I don't want to be more protective than I need to be. But I also want to have all the information and conversations with her I need to before she makes this decision/her sister arrives.

Any support/data/questions to help me understand if this can be done safely, and how I can be a good daughter in this are soooooo appreciated.

972,"I am COVID-19 positive, and my in-laws refuse to quarantine I am stuck in self isolation at my in-laws house because a family member tested positive while we were here. I am now COVID-19 positive. I am far away from my home and myfort zone, so far that return is not feasible (7+ hour drive and mostly rural). I did not feel good abouting down here because I know that at least two of his siblings work high risk jobs. 

Now I have tested positive, and my husband is negative but displaying mild symptoms, so presumptive positive. My MIL and FIL were exposed to us after we were exposed to the positive family member, but before said family member tested positive, so we had to stay here and monitor symptoms - but they have refused to stay home as long as they weren’t feeling sick. Now they are refusing to quarantine even though they work a business that is people-facing, even though I have tested positive and they have had contact with me, and I’m staying, you know, in their house. My MIL even expressed that she does not believe my COVID test result is real. 

They are upset with my husband when he wears a mask when he has to leave our room to go to the bathroom. When I go to the bathroom with mine they look at me funny or not at all. This is so confusing to me, because they have always struck me as kind people. Stubborn, but kind. Now there is a legitimate concern and they are acting like I’m delusional.

They say they don’t care if they get COVID, but *I* care if they get COVID. They forget that they are at higher risk than average, because they are both around 60 and one of some sort of lung malformation. They say we are living our lives in fear. They will not wear masks in the house themselves because they claim they cannot breathe with them on. We are wearing ours outside of the room, and they don’t like it, but will be doing so whether they like it or not. We are also lysoling every surface we touch in the bathroom after we go. 

MIL yelled at my husband tonight because he gently asked if they were going to get tested and told them that the doctor said they needed to quarantine, too. He is a very gentle person, rarely ever raises his voice. He has not had a single conflict with them in his life. Ever. He is the peacemaker in his family, a little bit of a Momma’s boy, but with an excellent head on his shoulders. He’s been carrying a lot of my weight this week emotionally, because I have panic disorder and recently came out of a very rough flare of chronic illness. I’ve had panic attacks daily this week, cried to him, cried at him, cried at the wall...He’s been my rock and taken care of me at my worst moments. I’ve not been in the best headspace and he’s helped me a lot.

He initially wanted to take this trip to relax and spend time with his family before we went alone to a cabin to celebrate a special milestone. Even if I wasn’t fully onboard with seeing every member of his family right now, I wanted him happy, and thought that a getaway in a rural cabin would be socially distant enough. But, it only takes one asymptomatic encounter to spread, and we let our guard down. I can tell he’s down, in a way he rarely gets. Physically he says he feels fine, but I know he needs emotional support, too.

And I, as someone with mental illness, need some positivity to get through this. My in-laws won’t kick us out, but I am worried about maintaining a positive outlook and keeping others safe while staying here. And we literally have nowhere else to go that wouldn’t involve a drive spanning hundreds of miles.",92,0.98,j74ins,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j74ins/i_am_covid19_positive_and_my_inlaws_refuse_to/,8,Support,2020-10-08,-13,204,-0.06372549019607843
973,"My friend's wedding is in less than two weeks, and she isn't taking any Covid precautions. My friend and I have very different views on the Covid situation; essentially, she doesn't take it seriously and possibly doesn't even believe the virus is ""real"". She's getting married in less than two weeks, and she has provided incredibly few details to the guests regarding what to expect or what to plan for. A few days ago I asked her what Covid precautions they have planned and if everyone at the venue will be required to wear masks. Her reply confirmed my worst fears.

Not only is she not requiring anyone to wear masks (""I guess you can wear a mask if you want lol"" was part of her text) and not taking any precautions, but it's like she barely even registers the fact that we are in the midst of a *deadly pandemic*. I don't get it, and I don't know how to respond.

I was already on the fence about going for several reasons, a major one being the virus, but I thought maybe if they were taking a lot of steps to try and keep everyone safe then it might be alright. But after what she told me, my final decision is that I'm not going; I'm not going to risk my health or the health of other people.

So I'm left wondering how to handle the situation. How do I tell her that I won't be there without majorly damaging our friendship? 

And there's also a small part of me that wonders why I even value the friendship so highly when she doesn't seem concerned with keeping her own family and friends safe. And then I feel like a terrible person for thinking that about someone I used to consider my best friend (we've been drifting apart for a little while now, even before Covid happened). I do care about her a lot and don't want to hurt her feelings.

974,"COVID-19 Has Interfered With My Ability to Cope As soon as SARS-COV-2 entered my state on March 3, I bought a box of masks and began socially distancing. I know that COVID-19 wouldn't kill *me*, but that it would spread to the more vulnerable, and I don't want that blood on my hands. But it's been miserable for me; mainly because my methods of coping sorta-kinda hinged on not being distanced.

Here's some background on me: I'm a 29-year-old woman who had an emotionally neglectful childhood. My parents were poor so they could never be around me. When they were around, they were cold and distant. My older sister was always out partying, so I was always alone. I was a ""gifted"" child (although I certainly don't feel gifted) and skipped a second, third, fifth, and eleventh grade, so I was always younger than my classmates, making it extremely difficult for me to be attached to them.

No one wanted to be my friend as a kid either - I was too ""dull."" So, in 2011, when I had bought my own home and gotten my own job as an accountant after graduating in 2010, I subconsciously decided to reclaim my lost childhood. So, ever since, I've spent my free time watching cartoons, collecting toys and stuffies, spending my Saturday afternoons in bouncy houses, and jumping around on hopper balls. Between 2011 and 2013, I was able to gather a group of similarly traumatized-women to spend time being adult-children with.

We love hugging, kissing, and giving each other raspberries. We spend hours browsing shops together. Beginning in January 2014, we started spending every Friday evening binging Steven Universe, Adventure Time, and later, We Bare Bears. But obviously, we haven't been able to be like this in months. It's awful. I just want my life back.

Thankfully, [we'll probably get a vaccine before November]( and the CDC says all Americans [who can get the vaccine will get it by July 2021]( with [normal life resuming in mid-June]( But seeing people talking about how we'll always have to be distanced (contradicting what Fauci, the top expert in infectious diseases, has to say, but whatever) still scares me.

Now it's jumped to at least 90% and I am still able to get that 10% of happiness left from my partner. She and my family have been the primary reasons why I haven't decided to do anything drastic to myself. Lately though I have found myself not wanting to be in this world that we are going through. Everyone is getting angry and upset at each other over politics I won't even say any of their names to not trigger anyone. Everyone is paranoid over getting COVID which is not a bad thing, but it reminds us every day we are living in a world filed with a deadly virus going on. I just can't take it mentally anymore.

Even though I consider myself an introvert I loved traveling to cities. Just being around people and in a city environment would always put me in a good mood. I loved exploring different cities and just being around people the energy was just amazing. I loved going to conventions they were one of my favorite things to do because not only did it get me and the gf a weekend together, but it allowed us to be at a place and around people that enjoyed the same thing that we were all there to be for.   


Now everything just feels dead. It's frowned upon if you go visit a city and even if you do it's definitely not the same feeling as before when cities felt more alive.

I will always wear eye protection, and a face shield. I will always sanitize everything, I will always make my friends and family wear a mask when theye over.

I dont care if it will just be our routine, a 'seasonal flu' or 'just another cold virus'. I refuse to be a confirmed case, I won't just be another number, it freaks me out. I'm trying my absolute best, even while working in a grocery store, to stay as clean and careful as possible.

I cant spend time with people who pose any risk to my health and my peace of mind.

I already suffer from a few different mental illnesses that make it difficult to get through the day, and I wouldn't be able to function or live if I was stricken with permanent COVID, as I see so many people are. I would rather have my physical health in isolation than be permanently sick and be able to go out and have fun with my friends.

980,"Tested Positive Today - Need Encouragement I need encouragement. This is a scary situation to be in. 

My COVID test came back positive today. Was exposed to a family member over the weekend who tested positive for COVID on Sunday. We had spent Friday and Saturday with him and he was fine, but my SIL claimed to have “allergies.” They usually get seasonal allergies around this time of year, so I tried to put it from my mind. Then on Sunday my BIL got really sick and tested positive. 

I started feeling mild symptoms on Monday, like headache, drainage, and a mild cough. It’s been okay so far, but we are quarantined at my MIL’s home, 400 miles away with nowhere else to go. We are pretty rural too, about 25 minutes away from the city.

The doctor at the testing site said that since I was so mild, he did not expect me to get any worse, but gave me an albuterol nebulizer in case I ever were to need it (I had asthma at one time but it’s not flared in a few years). I also have water soluble CBD oil that I use for my GI issues and anxiety - not sure if that helps but I saw at least one study that said it might. I have some mental health stuff, I take an antidepressant (Remeron) and Ativan as needed for panic attacks. I also take a beta blocker for heart palpitations. I was already on Pepcid AC for my reflux along with a proton pump inhibitor. I discontinued my birth control the day I found out I’d had exposure, because I read that it increases the risk of blood clots (and I figured, no sex for a while, lol). I’m also taking a crap ton of vitamins right now, and I drink a lot of water. 

I’m trying to stay upbeat. It’s all I can do right now, because I’ve had so much anxiety since Sunday, I know it can’t be good for the immune system. When I called my mother she went absolutely hysterical and my grandmother texted and called me in tears. I have a lot of faith that things will be okay. I still havemon sense and a healthy level of concern for those around me. I just have to think good thoughts, because I don’t know what else to do right now. 

My husband tested negative, but he had the same exposure than I did (more actually, since he was working with him on home repairs all day) has been with me constantly, and has the same symptoms sans headache. Even the doctor said he probably has it, a false negative. I think he should get retested in a few days, but we don’t know how that works (there’s not any kind of testing shortage in the area we are staying, but we don’t want to do anything that isn’t necessary). We are unsure where he will sleep tonight, if we should wear masks around each other (I am still wearing one whenever I’m leaving my room). The guest bedroom and a small living room are in a separate wing of the house on a different ventilation and AC system, so we have that going for us, the only thing is that the family shares a toilet, and there is really no way around that, although we have been lysoling it after every use. So he’s either sleeping next to me, who is infectious, or in the same space as the rest of his family, and potentially infecting them. It’s a very stressful situation. 

I feel okay right now, I’m just trying to stay upbeat because I know it’s going to be a while here. I really, really wish I was at home, where I am mostfortable, but I know that isn’t an option right now, especially considering that we live with my mother, who is diabetic. I just miss home so much. I am breathing okay and eating okay, although a little less than usual because of nerves. I just want everyone to be okay. I want to be okay. I want my husband to be okay. He is my world. I am a person of faith and I feel like that has helped me to cope with this a little better. I’m still scared. I need to hear something positive. Just recovered from a three month battle with a flare of chronic illness and was finally in a really great place. Please tell me something positive.

Covid is basically my worst nightmare. If I go out and do anything, even safely, I feel like I will get COVID for tempting fate. I am constantly telling myself I have a sore throat, fatigue, or a tight chest.  

I work non stop because it distracts me. When I take work off for the weekend or vacation, the anxiety sky rockets and I convince myself I’m sick. I’m in that place now. I should be enjoying a restful weekend after a hard week but instead I’m convinced I feel symptoms.

Am I the only one who thinks that denialism from some people both in authority and the general public is what is feeding the doomerism and sensationalism in the media? What I mean is take for instance what people have said both recently and since this pandemic started, ""Don't let this dominate you, don't give into the fear"" etc. all of that can be true and for sure the vast majority of people who get Covid-19 are likely to survive, however that sentiment doesn't mean anything if the person is either being being in denial of the disease or is going out of his/her way of downplaying the virus and ignoring social distancing and mask rules.

I realize that this isn't a not so subtle reference to the POTUS and I rather that we not get political since that is against the rules on here, with that said however given how many times a person lies to other people but then says something that is truthful, people don't believe that person. It's the classical story of the ""Boy Who Cried Wolf"".

This morning I woke up with a nervous energy, usual allergy symptoms and a tickle in my throat along with a bit of a cough. I took some Claritin around 10 and my cough as well as my other allergy symptoms have chilled out. I think my acid reflux may be a factor too as I had a spicy chicken sandwich for dinner last night.

Prior to this past Sunday, I hadn’t had any contact with anyone outside of my Wife and son for nearly 3 weeks; I’ve started working from home and made it a point not to leave the house. This Sunday, however, I had my landlord over to help me with a couple of things around the house as my Wife is pregnant. We moved two couches from the living room to the garage and we mounted a TV. We were both masked from start to finish; him in a surgical type mask and me in a double layered stitch cloth mask. When moving the couches we were both on either end and when it came to mounting the TV, he did most of the work (I’m not handy) and only came close to him for a minute while I stood underneath him and held something steady for him.

However, I want to get out of my living situation. I'm in the US, more specifically the south (so you know my state is handling COVID piss poorly,) and would like to move somewhere further north with a friend.

But shit is hitting the fan politically and I'm worried about the virus. Right now, I'm just trying to save money, but a few months or even a year down the road, I'd like to leave.

The person I'd be living with has already had the virus. She definitely had it, tested positive and had many of the telltale symptoms and everything.

I think, maybe, the person I currently live with and I had it too, in late April/early May, but I don't know this for sure as they were the only person able to get tested, and it came back negative. The reason I still suspect we had it is because we are related and both experienced similar symptoms we've never had for any other reason in either of our adult lives before, most notably being strange rashes. They weren't exactly the same, mine being a horribly painful one on the backs of my hands that lasted a few days, theirs being a horribly itchy one on their inner arms that lasted a couple weeks, but neither of us are prone to skin allergies in the slightest.

And strangely, during this time, my autoimmune illness' symptoms improved, despite my stress levels being off the charts. I don't know the science behind this sort of thing... but maybe its possible that my immune system was too busy fighting off something else to be attacking itself? I don't know.

I also had lingering chest pain for a month or two after this experience, and only recently has my heart rate returned to normal. That, I know, could easily just be the stress, but it is odd.

If I knew for sure I had indeed had it, I'd probably just go. I know there's some isolated cases of suspected reinfection, but they seem pretty rare and I'd probably take the risk. But I don't know for sure, and there's no certain way to know for sure, so...

**My question is,** even if the pandemic isn't over by the time I've saved enough money to leave... should I leave anyway, to get into a healthier living situation? Or is it too risky, and I should wait until Fauci or whoever deems things ""normal"" again? I'm really conflicted, frustrated and scared. I don't want to have to wait on an actually safe vaccine (obviously I'm not going to feel safe with a rushed one, if one is rushed,) but I worry that's my only feasible option.

It's so difficult to make big decisions when it feels like the whole world is standing still (or moving scarily, crazily chaotically, in the United States' case) thanks to the pandemic. Like... how am I supposed to move forward with my life when everything is such a mess?

I've been wondering this for a while now. I am hopeful we will get a vaccine sooner than later. But I read that polls from different countries show that only around 50% are willing to get vaccinated. Only around 20% will do it for sure.

I've been trying to look online what the consequences of this might be but I couldn't find anything. I read that you need at least 60% of the population to be vaccinated to get herd immunity. Would 50% be enough to keep the virus at least in check? I know it also depends on the vaccine efficacy.

I (21F) currently live with my family (parents are in their 50s, brothers are in their 20s. Oldest brother is a cancer survivor, and my other one is obese.) Everyone in my family, from what I've read, is at risk. 

I also fear for my fiance (36M) and stepson (12M). Fiance is a smoker that has been smoking on and off (not in the house or around his son, don't worry,) and my stepson has asthma. Also, there are heart issues in his family.

Every single day, I worry about my family's safety, my fiance and stepson's safety. I worry that one of them will catch it and not do very well. Then what? I can't bear to lose anyone. I don't know if I can take it.

1990,"Scared of long-term effects First up, this ising from an healthy adult (slightly over 20) with normal weight BMI and some-but-little fat who enjoys exercising. No health conditions whatsoever, besides few (undiagnosed) allergies and occasional pain on my hip (also undiagnosed, will seek treatment preferably sooner than later). Not bringing up my sex because around here (Finland), statistics say that women have higher risk of severe disease so I really have it difficult to believe that men are at a higher risk. 

Anyway, the things I'm scared of is mostly the idea of permanently losing my ability to live a normal life. I have had nightmares of the concept, and I've been terrified of things like going blind or developing tinnitus since I was much younger. I am an emotional person, so ""normal"" is a luxury to me even in the best of times, and anything threatening it makes me anxious.

I get a harsh fever about every six months, and every time it's pretty crippling, leaving me in a recurring state of fever dream-like feeling and shivering cold. The idea of having to suffer this *for years* makes my hair rise. I also fear the thought of losing my lung capacity or suffering heart damage. Brain damage isn't pleasing, either. Never being able to taste would significantly change my life, and I fear, for the worse. And this isn't even aprehensive list of long-term effects. 

Another thing that I've been thinking since March is that how do we know that one of the later health effects of COVID-19 isn't, you know, death? There are things that take a long time to kill a human but are lethal nevertheless. Radiation and genetic illnessese to mind first. I have an awful feeling that people will start dropping like flies in a couple of years, if not sooner. Because there's nothing preventing that from happening. All scientist know about the virus that it's a nasty cocktail of traditional coronaviruses and HIV, with the ability to spread asymptomatic. And to me, that's terrifying.

It doesn't help that my school has made classes 80 fucking minutes long. It means I only have 3 classes a day, but sitting through 80 minutes on mind numbing slideshows is miserable. The school seems very confident we'll be back in the building after Christmas, but I don't see how that's possible. To add insult to injury, if we don't go back to school at all this year, all of the things that make senior year special, like prom and my school's senior cruise (its just a dinner cruise lol), will be cancelled, and I don't know how or if I could handle that.

1994,"Good things to remember when you're frightened about the virus Here are some things I find to help me stay relaxed and sane about the current situation with the virus. Some might have already been said here but they're worth repeating!:

1. The exponential growth of new cases as we're shown now is not a model that can sustain itself for long, because it assumes everyone will keep meeting new people to infect every day. But in our daily lives, we generally keep meeting the same people. Even in public places, you will only keep meeting people who are healthy, naturally immune (this is a thing!) or have been cured of the virus (after all, sick people should stay at home or are hospitalized). So the bottom line is, people who spread the virus will run out of people to infect pretty fast. This is true for every single case.
2. We will not see millions of people worldwide die from this, because of regulations that are being put in place everywhere. COVID-19 will not be Spanish Flu 2.0., the Black Plague, etc.
3. The virus will not infect everyone. You're likely to be among those people as long as you follow the local regulations that are in place and follow basic hygiene instructions. Wash your hands, avoid sick people, wash your hands, do not go out (especially if you're feeling unwell!), wash your hands, do not travel, wash your hands, do not meet with other people unless it is strictly necessary. Wash your hands. Don't be a selfish prick. Please do wash your hands.
4. The virus presents itself as mild in 80% of *recorded* cases. This number is likely higher since not everyone with the virus calls their GP/CDC because symptoms are not severe enough. Remember, the influenzaviruses and rhinoviruses that spread themon cold are still around too.Even if you do get infected, you are very likely to experience symptoms akin to flu and nothing more severe than that. Young people might be able to develop more severe illness, yes, it happens but these cases are rare overall. This is not any different from flu where more severe illness in healthy and young people can happen as well.I had flu once when I was an otherwise healthy 15 years old. I was bedridden for two weeks, had a raging fever of 105F/40.5C for four days. I almost needed hospitalization. Thankfully I made a miraculous recovery before I reached that point. I haven't had anything that severe since, and I've had my fair share of flu and colds between then and now.
5. If you start showing symptoms and you start to panic and want to call emergency services right away: ask yourself if you would call them when you'd have the same symptoms if COVID-19 wasn't around. If the answer's no: stay at home, get some rest, and monitor your symptoms and health a couple of times a day. If you only have a mild cough for a couple of days and nothing else develops, for example, it's probably something else. But if you do develop a high fever and/or trouble breathing, call your GP or emergency services right away. Better safe than sorry. Don't go outside if you experience any symptoms no matter how minor, though!
6. Even in Hubei, a city with millions of citizens, less than 70.000 people got infected. That sounds like a lot, but in reality, it's less than 0,12% of their population infected. The vast majority of these infected people recovered as well. Their regulations were helpful for sure, so keep in mind to follow the regulations of your local authorities diligently to limit spread. You can make a difference!
7. The effects of regulations put in place today will start to show themselves in two weeks at earliest, so don't worry if numbers don't slow down right away. They WILL slow down sooner than later. China and South-Korea are great examples.
8. The media intentionally write articles in such a way that it would garner the most clicks and thus more money. And fear is what sells the best. They love throwing big numbers around but often fail to provide the bigger picture unless it can generate more fear and thus clicks/money. The news outlets I frequent do not mention the number of people that have recovered from the virus for example and only keeps on adding to the total number of confirmed infections whilst failing to mention that the first couple of hundred cases have already recovered. Try to approach the news with a more neutral and nuanced view. Again, Hubei. Almost 70.000 people infected. It's still just 0.12% of their population. Approach numbers with that mindset.
9. Limit your time getting informed about the virus. You will only be more likely to stumble across anecdotal horror stories and other scary things if you keep looking for more information. Only take the latest information seriously from sources such as your government, CDC and GP. Tune in to the news once or twice a day. Also, try to keep updated with news that's relevant for your area first and foremost. For example, news about new regulations in Asian countries is mostly irrelevant for you if you live in America.
10. This wille to pass. There wille a day where you wake up and you can resume your daily life as normal. This day is closer than the media, internet users and other skeptics make it out to be.

Stay healthy, vigilant and follow instructions of your local authorities in order to limit the spread!

His 02 levels were OK at the beginning, then this morning they went down to 52 percent, The doctors were able to get it back up to 65, but then he coded (heart stopped). They intubated him and apparently got his heart started again briefly, but it did not last and he passed away.

2001,"Just some things to remember to keep yourself sane It’s been hard toe to terms with this virus. The media and 24 hour news cycle makes it sound like we’re living in a stupid ass 14 year olds Pandemic game,plete with a virus named after a beer. For those of us who are investors, it seems as if one day it’ll zero out and there will be no economy left. For people in affected areas, it feels like the governments re dragging their feet no matter how much action.
Everyday seems to go from bad to worse, that there will be no light at the end of this tunnel, that uncontrolled spread is inevitable, worldwide cases will double by the day and tomorrow we’ll be living in bunkers with corpses strewn on the deserted streets. Any semblance of normalcy will be a distant memory for the last fading remnants of humanity.

With the media painting a picture that we are careening rapidly and inexorably to the demise of civilization and order, I think it’s high time for a reality check. Here are 5 things to remember at a time like right now. 

1. THIS TOO SHALL PASS. Repeat this 10 times every day. This too shall pass, this too shall pass. Remember three months ago when we all were supposed to have perished in nuclear hellfire in a war with Iran? Remember when it looked like Australia would be burnt to a crisp entirely by the end of January? Those situations were dire, but abated when they were given time. Perhaps some times pass harder, but they pass still. At some points, the worst will be behind us. Things will go back to normal, even if it is a slightly different normal. 

2. The recovery is inevitable. Imagine what kinds of great things that cane of the recovery and rebuild. A restored priority on transparency and democracy. Illiberal governments finally facing the music and being shown the door at long last. Unprecedented scientific advances in antivirals and vaccines. Countries that are more prepared than ever to deal with anything. Actual sick pay and labor laws. An economy that has prioritized the climate and is growing in ways it did not before. Hold on to your investments. You cannot profit of the recovery of something you sold. 

3. Humanity has ovee far worse, and by all means this will not be what past plagues were. The Black Death killed one third of Europe. Spanish flu killed 50 million. 1957 Avian flu killed 1 million. Swine flu in 2009 killed only 12500. Advances in medical technology have improved survival over time. Unlike any of the past pandemics, we can identify and map this virus, and develop a response strategy accordingly. We know the incubation period, how it works and who needs more protection. We have more ability to treat the even more dangerous sequelae like bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics. In 1918, penicillin was still a decade away, and viruses were a new concept. There is a reason Dr Tedros is saying this is the first time we have the ability to contain and control a pandemic. We as a whole can stop it right here . 

4. There is now a lot of public awareness and public action. Here is the thing: because of the incubation period, quarantines, lockdowns, and closures do not show effect until 10-14 days. Even at China’s peak, cases rapidly increased before plateauing two weeks after Wuhan’s lockdown. There needs to be patience for the actions today to mean fewer infections and deaths tomorrow. The horror numbers of 50-70% infectiones from zero controls and zero consideration until herd immunity steps in. It is far from an inevitability, even Hubei was able to plateau at 0.12% infected. If Italy is quarantining now they may not even get to that much. At the very least governments are doing something. 

5. There are things you can do to control your risk. Wash your hands, avoid touching your face, don’te into work sick. These are not just for now. These are good habits people should have been doing anyways, pandemic or not. It would be wonderful if subsequent flu seasons are less
Deadly because people picked up good habits.

The most important thing is not to give in to panic. A few weeks where things look a bit different is a flash in the pan when you have many years of life to live. Turn off the news, turn off the TV, focus on yourself and productivity while taking steps to protect yourself. This too will pass, if you’re willing to be patient.

2005,"Article: I have the coronavirus. So far, it hasn’t been that bad for me. It's from the Washington Post here:

But in case of a paywall I thought I'd paste the text for you.



**I have the coronavirus. And it hasn’t been that bad.**

I am in my late 60s, and the sickest I’ve ever been was when I had bronchitis several years ago. That laid me out on my back for a few days. This has been much easier: no chills, no body aches. I breathe easily, and I don’t have a stuffy nose. My chest feels tight, and I have coughing spells. If I were at home with similar symptoms, I probably would have gone to work as usual.

I caught the virus on the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that was quarantined outside Yokohama for 14 days, at the end of a 16-day cruise I took with my wife, Jeri. When I left the ship a couple of weeks ago, I felt fine. We checked our temperatures throughout our quarantine. Jeri and I got a swab test for the virus. Our temperatures were normal; they’d get the swab results back in 48 hours. Our test results had not arrived before we boarded buses for the airport, where two U.S. government planes waited for us.

As we took off from Tokyo, I had a bit of a cough, but I chalked it up to the dry air in the cabin. I felt pretty tired — but who wouldn’t, in our situation? I dozed off.

When I woke up, I had a fever. I made my way to the back of the cargo plane, where the Air Force had set up a quarantine area cordoned off with sheets of plastic. They took my temperature. It was over 103 degrees. So I took a seat in the quarantine area and fell back asleep until we touched down in California, at Travis Air Force Base.

Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came onto the plane and said that three of us who had been cordoned off would fly to Omaha (with our spouses, if they wanted toe along). The CDC had a quarantine location at the University of Nebraska’s hospital. We arrived on Feb. 17, greeted by a fleet of ambulances and police cars. Officials put me on a stretcher and wheeled me into a van, which made for a very dramatic scene. I easily could have walked myself, despite my exhaustion.

On the hospital campus, they put me in a biocontainment unit. The space was sealed off, with two double-paned windows that looked out on the hallway, and a large, heavy, insulated door. Two cameras watched me at all times; a set ofputer monitors were equipped with microphones, so that the medical staff and I couldmunicate with CDC officials at centralmand down the hall. The room had last been used for the Ebola outbreak in 2014.

A doctor and nurses reviewed my case with me and took a bunch of lab tests. They wore heavy-duty hazmat suits sealed with duct tape and equipped with motors that helped with air circulation. It looked like something out of “The Andromeda Strain.” When the test came back a few hours later, I wasn’t surprised to learn that I had the coronavirus. Later, the Tokyo swab confirmed the result — I had caught the virus even before I left the ship.

It didn’t scare me too badly. I knew my number was up. The way I saw it, I was going to get stuck in at least 14 more days of quarantine, even if I didn’t get the virus. So many fellow passengers hade down with the illness, including one of my friends, that I’d gotten somewhat used to the idea that I might catch it, too. My wife, however, tested negative and headed to quarantine at a separate facility a few blocks away. After those days being cooped up on the ship together, I think we both relished the alone time; we still couldmunicate through our phones.

During the first few days, the hospital staff hooked me up to an IV, mostly as a precaution, and used it to administer magnesium and potassium, just to make sure I had plenty of vitamins. Other than that, my treatment has consisted of what felt like gallons and gallons of Gatorade — and, when my fever rose just above 100 degrees, some ibuprofen. The nurses came to the room every four hours or so, to check my vitals, ask if I needed anything and to draw my blood. I got very good at unhooking all the monitors checking my oxygen level, blood pressure and heart rate so I could go to the bathroom or just pace around the room a little, to get my blood flowing. I never quite got the hang of hooking them back up without making a tangled mess. After 10 days, I moved out of biocontainment and into the same facility as Jeri. Now we can videochat from our separate quarantines, in neighboring rooms.

As of my most recent test, on Thursday, I am still testing positive for the virus. But by now, I don’t require much medical care. The nurses check my temperature twice a day and draw my blood, because I’ve agreed to participate in a clinical study to try to find a treatment for coronavirus. If I test negative three days in a row, then I get to leave.

The time has passed more quickly than I would’ve expected. With my laptop, I get as much work done as I can, remotely. I catch up with friends. I take walks around my room, trying to take a thousand more steps each day. I also watch the news. It’s surreal to see everyone panic — news conferences, the stock market falling, school closures — about a disease I have. It does seem likely that coronavirus will spread in the United States, but it won’t help anybody if we all panic. It’s true that the disease seems much more likely to be fatal for older people and those in poor health. I’m relatively fortunate: I’m still younger than the most at-risk groups, and I’m in good shape, giving me less cause for alarm. Others who contract the virus won’t be as lucky. At least six Diamond Princess passengers have died from the disease, of around 705 passengers who caught it.

Still, coronavirus doesn’t have to be a horrible calamity. Based on my experience, I’d rmend that everyone get a good digital thermometer, just as afort tool, so they can reassure themselves if their noses start running.

If you told me when I left home in January that I wouldn’t be back until March — that, instead, I would be confined for more than 24 days because I’d catch a novel virus at the center of what could be a pandemic — that would havepletely freaked me out. But now that it’s happening, I’m just taking it one day at a time.",466,1,fenuog,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fenuog/article_i_have_the_coronavirus_so_far_it_hasnt/,37,NA,2020-03-07,-23,399,-0.05764411027568922
2006,"Why even introverts are struggling with self isolation/quarantine - it’s not about being alone, it’s about the loss of agency and control. I came to realisation last year when I was quarantined for pneumonia induced sepsis (fingers crossed won’t happen again this year), that it isn’t always so much the being alone part that is so unsettling about being forced to isolate.

Being alone is a factor, but the crux of it is the loss of agency. Anyone can joke that they spend all their time alone in their room anyways, but the key difference is that they’re still in control. They can still see people if they want to. They can still make their own choices. They can leave if they want to, even if they don’t do so.

Meanwhile, if you are forced to stay alone at home now, with no other choices, you have lost control, autonomy, agency, and choice. Apart from the isolation that may drive loneliness and rumination, the feeling of your own life no longer being in your own hands is difficult to handle, to say the least. 

Interestingly, agency is at the centre of individualist cultural values, and this may correlate with why people living in collectivist cultures found it easier (though nonetheless a difficult time) to adjust to a sudden loss of daily agency. And why some people living in highly individualist cultures (such as America, Canada) are finding it very hard to emotionallye to terms with what’s going on. 

Nonetheless, things will be okay. Brains may take time to adapt, but they do.",441,1,fol7au,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fol7au/why_even_introverts_are_struggling_with_self/,61,NA,2020-03-25,-13,82,-0.15853658536585366
2007,"4/6 Final update on my mother: she passed away due to covid 19 on April 3rd My name is Charlie.

Original posts:




Her name was Amanda. She was 64. Ultimately after hearing all the options I decided it was enough. She never wanted to live long enough to where she couldn’t feed or bathe herself. She used to say she never wanted to prolong death, she wanted it toe quick. The doctor said the week in thea destroyed her organs and damaged her brain, so she even if by some miracle she survives, which was almost impossible, she would nevere close to living a normal life again.

Her life was just suffering and being in and out of hospitals. She was born with kidney disease and for me, from growing up until now it was always just seeing her on dialysis and in and out of hospitals. Over the last 10 years she probably had over a dozen serious hospitalizations. I’ve got too many memories of her being hooked up to machines. I will always be so full of anger that she could never experience a healthy life.

I will never forgive myself for several things. She knew I cared but I’m just a cold person by nature. I never sat and had a meal with her. No real conversations. Never went for a walk with her. The last time I fucking even hugged her was 2 years ago when I went to visit her in the hospital every day when she had pneumonia. Almost every day for the past few years I knew this was going to happen. She was going to die I was going to let regret eat me alive. I should have been better. 

But I did love her. I tried my best to make sure her doctors appointments and medications were set and always tried to get an idea on how she was feeling. Even if she was feeling bad she never wanted to show it. My half assed attempt to make up for lost time was taking her and her sister to Cirque Du Solei over the past two years. Just so she could experience something different in life, since she never went anywhere. April fucking 5th I had front row tickets for her and her sister. 2 months ago when I bought them I just hoped and hoped she would stay healthy enough to go, and then all this happened.

Probably the biggest thing that I will never forgive myself for is her last request. She knew I was a fuck up, but was always too nice to say it. Her sister told me a year ago that all she wanted to see before she died was me happy with a decent job, I couldn’t give her that. Nobody to blame but myself though. Almost 35 and nothing to fucking show for it. I’ll never forgive myself for that. I’m just worried about my brother who can’t look after himself. She was everything to him.

Meanwhile, I tested positive for covid, brother and dad negative and my aunt’s test hasn’te back yet. I’m getting retested on Tuesday. I can’t fucking stay locked in this small room anymore.

I’m hesitant to post this, but unbeknownst to me, my girlfriend set up a GoFundMe to help with burial costs over the weekend

I know I'll delete this probably later today, since I'm really starting to hate this sub and it shows, but I'm so fucking pissed and scared I want to scream. 

Every time I see someone talking about how they haven't gone anywhere in days, weeks, I feel so jealous I can't stand it. When I see videos of people joking about being stuck inside, with theirfy middle-class houses in the background, I look around at my cramped, raggedy rented bedroom, my uniform on a chair in the corner, and want to cry. When I see young, healthy people are being told that they'll be safe if they only get things delivered, because going to the stores is what *really* puts you at risk, I want to tell them *how the fuck do you think those groceries are getting to you?*

And, yes, I know- the least risky thing to do *would* be to have non-grocery-workers all get delivery, to lower the pool of people who could be spreading germs around the store. But even that plan leaves some people getting the short end of the stick. But that's okay, right? Greater good, and all that. We're used to it. 

And they started paying us more, for now. Company calls it ""appreciation pay"". Union calls it ""hazard pay"". Two dollars an hour. 

I hear a coworker coughing, a coworker who I've spent the whole day bumping into, brushing past, being breathed on. Someone else last night said they had a sore throat. I spent my lunch break sitting outside googling ""*can allergies cause sore throat?*"" 

Two dollars an hour? Two dollars an hour won't keep me from spending days, weeks, feverish and barely able to breathe. I look for support, and find a hundred articles on how to avoid getting sick from your every-other-week, as-fast-as-possible grocery trip.

2014,"My incarcerated dad just lost the battle with the virus A few weeks ago, I [posted]( about my incarcerated dad's battle with corona virus when he was first put in the hospital. A little bit later, I made a [post]( with an update on his condition. He was suffering from kidney failure at that point, which was responded to with dialysis. At first, he responded well to it and appeared to be showing progress for a couple days.

However, earlier today I was informed that after all of the doctor's best efforts, they had determined he would no longer be able to be saved after suffering so much damage to his body and the doctors took him off the ventilator.

I don't even know what to think. I feel like I'm going insane.

2015,"I'm 24 with coronavirus. It's hard but the stigma is just as bad TLDR: exposed to coronavirus, developed coronavirus symptoms, had mild yet very scary experience, coronavirus test came back negative, went to the ER, doctors think it was a false negative, slowly recovering, symptoms mostly gone, finally out of isolation

I just wanted to share because there aren't many people I can talk to about this. I'm a healthy, 24-year-old female and I have coronavirus. I hung out with a friend on March 7, before all of the protective measures were in place. She got it from a coworker and I got it from her. My symptoms didn't show up until 15 DAYS LATER.

SYMPTOMS

Day 1 - slight cough, nasal and chest congestion, stomach cramps (i thought it was my perioding on...), no fever, slight fogginess/fatigue; at this point, I thought it was the early stages of a cold

Day 2 - chills at night, woke up with 100 degree fever, strange headache (it didn't hurt but intense pressure), I tried to get out of bed but quickly realized I didn't have the energy, my heart was racing as if I had just sprinted a marathon; this is when I knew I had acquired coronavirus; those symptoms only lasted 10-15 mins. With this virus, it's off and on - something new every day.

Day 3 - no cough, no fever, hard to breathe due to chest and nasal congestion, I have to take deep breaths like I'm meditating; my doctor assured me that these are mild symptoms, and I believe her. I've been well enough to work and do normal things. The symptoms only get bad at night when it's difficult to catch my breath.

TAKEAWAYS - This is nothing like I've ever experienced. Coronavirus is unique because it affects your upper and lower respiratory tracts. I know I'll be fine - the key is staying calm, doing some deep breathing exercises, rest, hydrate, and medicate. But I see how this is dangerous for older adults and adults living with chronic illnesses/conditions.

TESTING - It hurts like hell to get the coronavirus test. They stick a long wire deep in your nose for 15 seconds. It burns. I cried. I get my results back in 4-7 days but I know I have it. Get tested if you can!

ANXIETY - I'm afraid I may have passed it to my mom and my little sister during the two weeks that I was asymptomatic. Every day is a waiting game. I feel so guilty even though I haven't intentionally done anything. I worked from home. I isolated when they told us to. Yes, I still had a few one-on-one hangouts early on. No, I didn't think they woulde back to haunt me.

STIGMA - It's almost as bad as the virus itself. I feel embarrassed, I feel ashamed, I feel like I didn't socially distance well enough, I feel like I can't tell my friends or my coworkers. I don't want their judgment. Social media shamers have made it worse (people who mean well but are posting things that are deeply stigmatizing) - it creates an ""us vs them"" environment. Please be kind with your language.

Advice from the World Economic Forum:  [

""WORDS MATTER. It's not a “plague” or an “apocalypse”; it's not a “Chinese” or “Asian"" disease; and people with COVID-19 should not be described as “spreading the virus”. ""

DON'T talk about people “transmitting COVID-19” “infecting others” or “spreading the virus” as it implies intentional transmission and assigns blame.  ""Using criminalizing or dehumanizing terminology creates the impression that those with the disease have somehow done something wrong or are less human than the rest of us, feeding stigma, undermining empathy, and potentially fuelling wider reluctance to seek treatment or attend screening, testing and quarantine.""

&#x200B;

UPDATE - 5/6/20

**Before I write about the rest of my experience, I want to apologize if this post made anyone anxious. I didn't realize this wasn't the right group, and I should've looked around more before posting.**

Day 4 - didn't feel any better, didn't feel any worse; mentally and physically tired

Day 5 - tossed and turned all night (it's always worse at night) due to bad chest congestion, bad chest pressure, shortness of breath, stomach cramps, mild coughs; I woke up that morning with the worst headache I've ever experienced, very low energy, bad stomach ache; This was the worst I've felt so far; I slept most of the day; I was afraid that this was the ""turning point"" that so many reference before ending up in the hospital

Day 6 - a freaking great day, I woke up feeling so good, which is weird because the day before was the worst; I thought it was finally over

Day 7 - experienced real shortness of breath, like I hadn't experienced before; rapid heart rate; couldn't do anything but stay in bed; this was a sad day

Days 8-12 - I stopped journaling because I was too depressed; being sick during a global pandemic really messes with your mental state

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENED - MY TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE

The doctors told me to go to the ER. Nobody could figure out what my symptoms were or why my test came back negative. They told me that it was likely a false negative and that given my symptoms, I likely do have coronavirus and should continue to isolate. One nurse told me that my viral load was likely too low for the test to pick up the virus - this isn't surprising because I'm generally healthy and young. They decided not to do another test because I was getting better and a 2nd test wouldn't have changed my treatment. Also, those tests are expensive and labs are already at capacity - better to save that test for someone who actually needs it.

TODAY (15 days since my first symptoms appeared) - I'm slowly getting better. Every day I feel more and more like myself, but recovery hasn't been linear. Some days I'm very fatigued. Some days I feelpletely fine. The important things is, most of my symptoms are gone. I'm finally out of isolation. I can play with my little sister again (my family is all fine, it's been 2+ weeks and no one is sick). Every time I breathe I'm so grateful. I went for two weeks without being able to take a deep breath. 10 days isolated in my room with no contact. There were nights I was convinced I wouldn't wake up - and my symptoms were ""MILD"".

Overall, I feel very blessed and lucky to be alive. My heart goes out to everyone who has it worse.  The fact that my test came back negative was a cruel twist. But maybe it was a blessing in disguise. Having a low viral load could be the reason none of my friends or family members got sick. But what are the chances that I got a virus that mimics the same disease occurring during a global pandemic?

If anything, this will make a hell of a story to tell one day. I hope you all are doing well.

It seems like I wake up forcing myself to even do anything because I’m so depressed. Also, I feel super lonely. Yes I understand that the reason is because of social distancing but I feel incredibly, horribly lonely. It’s like I’m also feeling grief because of everything.

2031,"My incarcerated dad fell ill to the virus, he's not going to make it. About 2 weeks ago, I made a [post]( when my dad first tested positive for corona virus. It was very reassuring to see so many people offering their condolences and prayers for him. 

However, today I received a call from a nurse at the hospital he's currently at. 

He is suffering from serious issues in his kidneys. He can no longer breathe on his own. The nurse said, ""we don't want to sugar coat anything. He's probably not going to pull through.""

I'm going to visit him tomorrow for what will probably be the last time. After being wrongfully imprisoned for so long and being up for release *next year,* his story ising to an abrupt end.

I just don't even know what to do at this point. Everything I have done in my life was because of him. He was always calling to verbally kick my ass whenever he heard I was screwing up. He would always give me support and advice whenever I talked about plans I had of any kind. He was always there for me whenever I needed him, despite being locked away. Nothing could break our bond and nothing could stop him from being a great dad.

His family is part of the reason he's in prison, they no longer speak to him and I returned the favor to them. They're a bunch of dysfunctional, narcissistic assholes. My mom's family is all dead, one of them I lost only 2 years ago. It's just her and my uncle now. It feels like I have nobody left. It feels like I have nothing left. 

All my life and everything I've done was because I loved to hear my dad tell me how proud I was. He showed up to all my football games, even though I never really got to play at all. He always made me handmade birthday cards while he was in prison. He took me to meet celebrities (he was a small time actor that got to play side roles in a lot of blockbuster movies). I know everyone says this same exact thing, but he was the last person I feel should suffer the way he has and is.

I guess maybe I'm acting like a helpless child because I don't have my parent to show me what to do, but that's what I really feel like. I only just turned 22. He is only 48.

2032,"My neighbours (who aren’t social distancing) have been very rude to me ever since I wouldn’t let their sick child pet my dog Basically what the title says. I only leave my house to walk my dog and to go to the supermarket with extreme caution. Besides the people I live with, I haven’t been in physical contact with anyone since 12 March.

My neighbours on the other hand have not been social distancing at all as far as I can see. They still have friends over, they’re CONSTANTLY fucking around on the street between our properties meaning any time someone from my house needs to leave they have to walk right past them. 

Their seven-year-old son has had covid symptoms for the past few days and they STILL allow him to play outside on the street. The other day I wasing back from walking my dog and the child came running down the driveway to pet him like he often did before this started. I told him in the friendliest voice I could that he couldn’t pet my dog right now and that he was a great boy for being so understanding. The child didn’t even seem that bothered.

Judging by the parents’ reaction you would have sworn I’d said somethingpletely unreasonable. They started condescendingly explaining to me that dogs can’t get the virus, as if that’s what I was worried about. I calmly told them that I have elderly and immunpromised relatives and if their child is sick, I really don’t want to take any chances. They scoffed at me and acted like I was beingpletely out of line.

Every time I’ve left the house since then, they’ve made some kind of snidement to me about how I’m somehow being hypocritical by walking my dog while not wanting anyone to pet him. I don’t know if these people have ever had dogs, but dog owners typically don’t take their dogs for walks for the benefit of strangers who might want to pet them. The issue was never even about my dog in the first place. IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN’T WANT THEIR GERM-INFESTED CHILD TO POTENTIALLY PASS THE VIRUS ONTO ME.

I’m the most non-confrontational person on the planet so this prolonged passive aggression is really upsetting me. My SO says that they probably know they shouldn’t have allowed their child outside but won’t admit they’re wrong so instead make it seem like I’m the one with the problem.",305,0.98,g03ljm,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g03ljm/my_neighbours_who_arent_social_distancing_have/,71,Support,2020-04-13,-16,119,-0.13445378151260504

2035,"My dad is Day 5 on the vent and is stable Hi all,

My dad (60 years old- no underlying health conditions- never chain smoked only casual cigars for special occasions) got admitted to the hospital last Thursday. We thought he was doing okay with the noninvasive nostril oxygen but he needed more. The doctor and their team decided to intubate my dad. 

It was very surreal to talk to my dad on the phone and not knowing if it would be the last time that I would ever speak to him. I told him to be strong and we are rooting for him. My dad is now on day 5 and his doctors and nurses have been wonderful. They call me twice in a day to give me updates. The day after he got intubated they called and said his eyes are open and he is writing things down. 

I asked what he was saying and it was things like “how much longer of this? And how is my wife?”... 
:( they said he became super anxious so they needed to sedate him. That was on Tuesday. So every day after they have called saying he is the same... his vitals are stable and he is one of the more stable patients. 

He has been sedated since and isn’t awake... same thing though chest x rays are the same... nothing worsened over night but his lungs still aren’t strong enough to be weened off. I asked the doctor how long they have been having COVID19 patients on these vents for...

She said since it’s so new they aren’t really sure but other hospitals are saying two weeks. I see all the bad news articles and it’s been breaking me down. So I said fuck this I am going to dig for good news and anything I can hang on to for hope...

I found a twitter thread of a nurse asking if anyone had good oues of patientsing off the vents and surviving. They said yes actually. They have had patientsing off and recovering! Which made me have more hope. 

I know we can only take this day by day but I was wondering if anyone else is going through something similar like my dads situation? I have found some threads on Reddit and spoke with people whose parents or spouses are going through it as well. I just like to connect andpare notes even though I know every single case is different. 

Stay well to everyone and make sure your mentally okay. I’m here to talk if anyone needs to vent. 🙏🏻♥️

Edit/addition to: My mom got the virus as well not nearly as bad as my dad.. she tried to handle it herself in their house (she’s a nurse) it finally got too bad that we got her an ambulance and rushed her to the hospital. On top of having COVID19 she was experiencing an Afib. They got that sorted out and she stayed in the hospital for 5 days. She got discharged today with an oxygen tank and we don’t know how long she will need oxygen for... I’m happy she is recovering though but I just want my dad to be okay as well

**Update- Day 6 4/5/20** my mom spoke with one of his doctors that she personally knows (so far my mom hasn’t known any of the docs and she is a retired nurse that worked in that hospital for 30 plus years) she said he currently is still stable, doesn’t need that much oxygen help from the machine, he is almost finishing up with his antibiotics so now it’s a wait and see like it has been... but I will take any good news as a step forward. Thank you again everyone for the love and support. I will keep you all updated!

**updated: check out my post on The subreddit CoronavirusUS- i found a picture on Facebook of a New Jersey (not my dads hospital- even though we are in New Jersey) how many people who got off of ventilators and have been discharged in general from the virus... it’s giving me more hope! **

Update 4/7/2020 My mom Just spoke with another anesthesia friend doctor.  She is taking care of My dad today.  Doing the same, very stable.  They are talking about lightening his sedation but not enough that he would be aware.  Too soon to wean off vent but hopefully soon they will start weaning to see how he can breath on his own. 🙏🏻♥️


**Update 4/8/2020** My dad is day 8 being on the vent. He continues to be stable.  Still about the same.  Resting quietly still pretty sedated.  No plans to take him off anytime soon.  His lab work is starting to return slowly towards normal...which is good.  He is the “best” pt and closest to getting off the vent!  His bowels are not moving well, so they are trying something new today. I just wanted to keep you guys updated since I hate reading stories on here where there is no update our oue! I care about you random strangers and enjoy reading your stories bute on with not updating? Lol stay well fellow redditors! Thank you for the continuous support and prayers!

**update 4/10/20** GREAT NEWS!! They extubated him today after being on the vent for 11 days (lucky number 11 I guess!)  and he is drowsy obviously and still confused but they are moving him out of the ICU to another floor to recover more. His throat is sore (from the tube obviously) and my mom talked to him on the phone and he was just making noises probably because he's still sedated and out of it but he is extubated and recovering. Thank god! We Continue to pray though because he needs the strength to get himself to recover from this!  🙏🏻♥️ thank you to everyone who has been by my side during this horrific time.

God fucking damn everything. Dad somehow tested negative. Still waiting to hear about my aunt and brother. Of all the fucking things to happen in a 2 week span. 

No one can give my a clear answer about when I can be considered clear. The fucking guy who called said since we’ve been quarantined for 8 days I should wait another week before getting two back to back negative tests. The fucking shitty hood doctor I have said wait two weeks then if I show no symptoms I’m fine. The doctor who’s treating my mother said I can count those 8 days I already have towards those 14 days then get tested. So no straight answers. 

I feel fine. Maybe a light throat tickle cough for 3 or so days, nothing major. No temp. The guy on the phone said a lot of people are reporting loss of taste and smell. 

Despite them saying mom was gonna die a day or so ago she’s somehow still alive, still said there’s no hope of survival though. They called literally as I was on the phone speaking to my shitty doctor. I told them to stop calling me unless it’s to tell me she’s dead or pulls through.

2039,"Am I the only one who is still taking this seriously? Lately, I see more and more people going out and about without masks or gloves. Also, a lot of them aren’t practicing social distancing either. Yesterday, I was at the grocery store and I saw quite a few peopleing in and out of the store not wearing masks. Today, I went to the pharmacy to pick up my anxiety medication and the pharmacist was not wearing a mask or gloves when she was handing me my medication. 

For a minute, I thought that maybe I’m crazy and that maybe it’s not such a big deal. I still wear a mask and/or gloves whenever I have to go out and I still generally keep my distance from people who aren’t in my household. It’s not so much about me getting it as it is my parents getting as they are high risk due to age and serious medical conditions.

I live in Georgia and my state is technically reopened, but I am still mostly only going out when it’s essential. It’s not because I necessarily have to, but it’s by choice because I want to protect myself and my parents, whom I still live with.

2041,"For those with health anxiety I have severe health anxiety with OCD. Yay!

I did counselling a while back and thought I’d share some tips.

1. Everyone is worried, but some have better self-soothing coping mechanisms. We need to up our game with the self-soothing. 

2. One really important breakthrough in therapy for me was to understand that people can get through illness (even serious) and keep living a fulfilled life. I was in panic-catastrophising-doom mode and my brain wasn’t working properly - I was convinced my life was over...without being ill!

We don’t know enough about the virus yet to know what’s going to happen. We don’t know how it is going to personally affect us and we can’t control that anymore than what we’re already doing. Yes, it could kill us, that is a possibility. But there’s lots of things in life that can kill us and we don’t obsess over them. By continuing to search online, you are trying to control what’s going to happen to you, but you can’t (because you’ve already done all you can). 

3. Stop looking online. You’ve likely prepped in every way possible. You know you will self isolate if you get sick. You know every precaution possible now. Looking at coronavirus subreddits is just carrying on the cycle of your fear and taking you out of whatever you’re doing in the moment. It could even be your mind’s version of escapism - I know it is for me. It’s a way to make my mind obsess and worry over something out of control. But the best coping mechanism is self-soothing. 

4. Identify what makes you feel better and do it as soon as you feel anxious (if you can). Baths, reading, listening to music, reaching out to friends. Take this time as a time to look after yourself and prioritise yourself. Treat yourself as if you’re already unwell (which we are as mental illness is very real) and you need to wind down a bit and do things to make yourself feel better. Learn to believe you deserve to self soothe and you deserve to switch off from scary things. For me, I have a maladaptive belief that if I keep thinking about something constantly, I am keeping myself prepared. Actually what I’m doing is keeping my body in a constant state of anxiety that will make it harder for me to fight a potential infection. Self soothing is a preventative measure! 

And finally...

Here’s an exercise I did in therapy. It makes you challenge your beliefs and rationalise them. 

Belief “if I get seriously ill, people won’t believe me or they’ll be angry”

Evidence for (valid childhood traumas that triggered the health anxiety in the first place):

- Other kids thought I was faking it to skip school

- People would get annoyed at me cancelling 

- Some people got frustrated 

- Lost out on jobs and opportunities 

- Saw my sister not be believed with her long term health condition and it took her years to be diagnosed

Evidence against:

- Took time off work and boss was fine

- Kids who got angry with me had their own issues and got angry with a lot of people for other things

- I am not responsible for other people’s reactions, nor can I control them 

- People’s frustration is often with the health anxiety itself

New belief

“If I get seriously ill, it won’t necessarily make people angry. I can help myself more than I think. I can develop a support network”

I’ll try and do it with coronavirus:

“This is going to cause a global pandemic with serious implications. Im not going to have fun for months, could drag out years. I’m going to lose my job if I have to self isolate. I won’t be able to pay rent. I could die or someone I love could die”

Evidence for:

- Bad job 

- Higher mortality rate than flu

- Countries going into lockdown

- Scary stories emerging 

- Hospitals won’t be able to cope 

- Always get badly ill with respiratory infections

Evidence against:

- There will be other jobs. Maybe work from home online jobs will pop up as the economy adapts 

- Lower mortality rate than SARS

- Most people have mild symptoms 

- Landlords will have to accept late payments 

- Sensationalist headlines from news outlets that don’t have the full picture yet who generate clicks out of fear 

- If I self isolate, I can do that hobby I’ve always wanted to do - play more guitar, write a book, watch every Netflix series. It’s a chance to reevaluate what’s important in my life 

- One year of no holidays is nothingpared to all the holidays I’ll go on in the rest of my life 

It is scary, there are no doubts about that. But after coronavirus, there will be something else to be scared about. Before coronavirus, there was world war three in January!

Once I stopped worrying I had cancer, I started worrying I had a brain tumour. You need to tackle the anxiety itself.

Belief “I am going to get ill and die”

Reality “anxiety about potential events I have no control over is ruling and ruining my life right now”

The best thing you can do for yourself right now is treat your anxiety because that’s the biggest threat to you, as it’s stopping you going about your daily life with a healthy mind.

2044,"F 92 CoViD survivor now dying, can you keep her in your thoughts in the next week... (TW for depression & suicide mention) My Great Aunt Marg (92) survived CoViD-19 last month, but the virus severely weakened her, she's not been eating or drinking, my mum (a doctor) says she'll likely not live for the week. 

If you're religious can you keep her in your prayers, her church was one of her biggest loves when she was active & she loves frogs. 

About Marg:

She's a lovely lady but barely talks anymore, she used to play piano and sing for her church. When she was younger she suffered from depression and tried to kill herself, I always thought she always covered up the scars on her wrists with loads of heavy bracelets and bangles she wore constantly. When me and my sisters used to visit her as kids her whole terrace house was kitted out like it was still the 70s, but every available surface was covered in ornamental frogs. She gave me a bottle of Calvin Klein Shock perfume once for a birthday gift (she's not always been the best at presents, sometimes you'd end up with things you know she'd had in a cupboard for years, so the perfume was like 10/10 present wise) and it's been my favourite ever since. She lost her husband Les a few years ago, I hope she's at peace with the idea of leaving us to go wherever he's gone.

This is my first CoViD-19 death, I'm scared my Nana (93) will catch it since they both live not very far from eachother. 

I've known a lot of people die this year just from natural circumstances and possibly from being young and reckless. Another person leaving is hitting hard and I bdon't really know what to say or how to process this healthily, but I'm trying.

My thoughts are with all of you and your loved ones, I hope we all make it through this and learn whatever lessons this may teach us.

This is the FIRST worldwide pandemic occurring during mass social media. 

Sars was back in 2003, before Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit even existed. H1N1 even occurred in the baby years of those sites.

There is so much information, misinformation, fear mongering, lies, etc. being constantly shoved into our faces that it's turned into one big overwhelming mess. 

Every news site wants to be at the forefront, to the point they will print misinformation stretching to outright lies. Most will get more and more outrageous topete with one another for that viewcount. 

Just remember that Doctors and Scientists all over the world are working around the clock to not only find a vaccine, but better ways to manage symptoms. The best way you can help is by maintaining social distancing to give them that needed time.

Take breaks from social media, find things to better occupy your mind, get some physical activity, be safe, wash your hands, and of course stay home / avoid places people normally congregate.

2049,"Anyone else just feeling mentally exhausted? Ah 2020 the year of the Coronavirus, Loss of Jobs, Murder Hornets, a huge increase in Black Lives Matter protests and riots around the world.  


This year has got to be one of the most mentally draining years we have ever faced. So much is happening within a short time frame that it's a lot to take in. In a matter of a couple of months we went from worrying about a virus, to worrying about your job security, killer bees, protests and riots that is happening across the world.  


All of this happening at the same time is just making me more anxious and more uneasy with everything going on. I don't think anyone could argue that this is one of the worst years we have had in our life time. There might be one or two other years that had incidents, but nothingpared to this and everything happening at the same time.  


I know the last thing I should probably be concerned about is how my mental health is doing when we are dealing with viruses and protests that is a lot bigger than myself. I know other people are dealing with the virus and racism at the same time. I just can't help but feel mentally drained from it all.   


I've gotten to the point where I am just mentally exhausted with what is going on. Having to process a lot of things going on around me is taking a toll.

His parents don't seem to give a shit in the slightest. I'm frustrated as can be right now.

2054,"Ex-anxiety sufferer hereing with a message: the brain is a powerful tool, but beware the monkey mind! The brain is the most powerful thing we have in our bodies. I firmly believe fear to be our most primal and strongest emotion. Our brains are wired for self-preservation first and foremost. Anything that could cause our death should be avoided and that is what creates fear. Some fears are rooted in our very DNA it seems- arachnophobia is a good example. It's a leftover fear from more ancient times. At any rate, It's no wonder this virus sends anxiety levels through the roof for some. 

Buddhist monks say we have two minds. The first one is slow, one of logic and reason. It needs time to mull things over before reaching a decision on something. The other is the 'monkey mind'. Those who meditate might be familiar with it: it's the one that goes wandering when you're trying to focus. The monkey mind lives solely in the fast lane. It's spontaneous. It is stimulated by excitement, imagination and most importantly, in this case, anxiety. 

The monkey mind is more powerful than simply turning you into a nervous wreck. It can actually create real bodily sensations when there are no physical ailments. I had cardiophobia. I experienced shortness of breath, weird chest sensations, dizziness, fatigue, chest pains, heart palpitations... The typical heart problem indicators. But every physical test turned out negative. Blood tests came back A-ok. My body was 100% fine. My rational mind knew I was fine all along. But my monkey mind believed otherwise and made me feel things that weren't there.   
If your anxiety skyrockets because your monkey mind is running rampant with thoughts like 'what if this one cough is the beginning of the end?' and 'I feel hot omg I am having a fever!' it will surely make you feel all those symptoms and more. So how do you control your monkey mind?

Buddhist monks say there's one misconception about meditation: that you can truly empty your mind while meditating. You can't. They can't. The monkey mind won't allow it. **The trick is simple though: you must give the monkey mind something to do**. Ergo: *mindfulness.* The monks have their monkey minds focus on their breathing while meditating. 

Thankfully, practicing mindfulness is pretty easy. Imagine your monkey mind being a dog on a leash. Anytime it wants to wander off, you tug on the leash to keep it close to you. Every time your monkey mind wants to wander into the 'what if' section, consciously say 'no' to it (speak it out loud!) and consciously take in your surroundings. Then, move on to do something that you can occupy your monkey mind with. Watching TV, spending time with your family, working out, reading a book, listening to music, meditation, anything works really. Obviously, don't go look for more coronavirus news, it will only feed your monkey mind! Try to limit your time on this sub as well. The less you're thinking about anything that has something to do with this virus, the better you'll be able to keep your monkey mind tight on that leash!

I hope that this might help some of you deal with your anxiety for a bit. Though I do have to add, if you really have anxiety issues in general: seek professional help! I did this too for my anxiety and it has helped me immensely and got my life back on track. That's why this virus doesn't scare me as much. I approach any news with my slower, rational mind. My monkey mind's too busy with other stuff.",262,1,fnwm5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fnwm5l/exanxiety_sufferer_here_coming_with_a_message_the/,10,NA,2020-03-24,-14,221,-0.06334841628959276

My dad was so worried about getting sick he only left the house to go to work and my mom only left to get groceries. My sisters and I were at home 24/7 till June when I had to go to my college apartment to work + do summer classes remotely in a place where I had my own room (I shared my room with 2 other sisters). After I left I came back home just in time for fathers day, celebrated with my dad...not knowing that would be the last time I saw him alive. I went back to my apartment not knowing my whole family would catch COVID that same week...from my dad who caught it at work...from a co-worker who went to the beach a week prior. My dad did everything he could to protect us. His job didn't allow him to work from home, but he took all the safety precautions we were told (mask, gloves, lots of hand sanitizer). I lost my dad to a virus people aren't taking seriously. It's so frustrating to see people treat this as a joke....especially where I'm from (south Florida). Everything is a reminder of what I've lost. Being stuck inside makes grieving so much more difficult. My mom and sisters have antibodies but since I never got sick (my test was negative) I don't have any. Because my dad was the only one who worked, my mom and I now have to expose ourselves to be able to support our family. I'm so mad at everything....I'm so mad at the world and I don't know how to cope.

This current doctor I've met before on a pharmacy rotation at one of the network hospitals almost 3  years ago. He's a hard military man who got out of active duty and now works in critical care. He was cold and unforgiving when I was a student, and when I talked to him today, he's about the same.

My older brother (I'm 26) went to the hospital March 25th with COVID like symptoms and then intubated the day after he was admitted with a fever of 102F. Everyday I asked the hospital staff information about his labs, his breathing progression, his kidneys, organs, medications, any information that would help me understand how he was progressing.

I could tell by the labs and his breathing that he really didn't improve much. It's been about 10 days and he's still on a ventilator. They now found blood in his endotracheal tube. The doctor told me that bleeding in patients is easy to treat if it's caused by cancer/tumors, or other external factors, but the fact that he's bleeding means he is bleeding in his lungs. The infection is getting more severe even with antibiotics for ventilator associated pneumonia.

So today he asked me...  to try and decide. I asked him how much time does my brother have left? He said give or take one or two days. I can't even leave my military base (in Oklahoma) right now to go back to my family (in Pennsylvania) because I still need permission from the General Commander.. My mom tested positive for COVID March 19th and she's technically still on quarantine with my dad who was negative.  My mom has been begging me not toe because she doesn't want to see me get sick and end up like my brother. But I told her that I need toe home, I don't think the hospital staff will let me see him but if he... passes... I want to see his body at least.

The doctor said we can either

1. continue to let him stay sedated... see if he can try to continue to fight his infections. He would need to significantly improve in a matter of a day or two, if he doesn't then he's probably going to... pass away... sedated, while trying to fight.
2. wake him up. say our last good byes.

I'm scared to have to make a decision. I talked to his boyfriend and he told me that my brother would want to keep fighting. I want him to fight too  but I know my mom wants to say bye, but we can't go into the hospital to say goodbye. It would have to be over video call... He would die alone in the hospital without anyone. he would be woken up after 10-14 days of being asleep and being suddenly told ""we can't save you. Say good bye forever."" I can't bear it. I'm falling apart at the seems. For anyone who's reading this thank you for reading it all. I would like for anyone to tell me if they had to make a hard decision like this before or if they lost anyone and what it was like. I've never lost a family member before... I am just totally lost. Thank you.

tldr; older brother,31 relatively healthy ended up on a ventilator for 10-12 days. doctor told my family either we let him keep fighting for 1-2 more days to see if he gets better, if not he will die regardless or we wake him up and say good bye remotely from phone call.

Update: Thanks everyone who replied,   I made a new post  [ 

I just wanted to update those who responded to let them know he's still alive... Still fighting.",248,0.99,fwbacj,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fwbacj/my_31_year_old_brother_was_given_2_more_days_to/,113,Firsthand Account,2020-04-07,-20,205,-0.0975609756097561

2066,"Getting really frustrated by the ""stay the fuck home"" brigade I started taking this seriously before any of my friends and family did. I remember in January being frustrated by the ""just a flu bro"" folks when I knew that it wasn't just a flu. I started staying at home before lockdowns were put in place in my state. So I know and understand the importance of staying at home as much as possible.

But lately, I've been seeing a lot of people (especially here on reddit) begin to get hostile about calling for people to stay at home. It seems like everything--even just news articles--have scores of draconian ""stay the fuck home"" voices in thement section. Talk about safe ways of getting outside? Stay the fuck home. Talk about driving to your mom's to drop off food from a distance? Stay the fuck home. Talk about reopening things slowly and safely? Stay the fuck home. That's their answer to everything.

For some people, being able to stay at home is a luxury. There are other people (some of whom are friends of mine) who are facing homelessness right now because rent and bills are still due and they can't work. There are others who have struggled with clinical depression their whole lives and who are now contemplating suicide for the first time in years. There are others who are in abusive or negative situations at home who now have no escape.

So I wish the totalitarian calls to stay home would stop. To me, those just reek of privilege and virtue-signaling. At least hear people out and help people who need to go out do so in a responsible manner.",245,0.84,g69gw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g69gw8/getting_really_frustrated_by_the_stay_the_fuck/,141,Discussion,2020-04-23,-11,97,-0.1134020618556701

Come Monday it was worse and I was then registering temperatures in the 38s. Still felt absolutely fine in myself. 

Tuesday I felt like crap. Proper flu symptoms and didn't want to move from bed. Cold, despite 2 thick duvets and PJs. Body temp high 38s. 

Wednesday. Oh the muscle pains. I've never felt anything like this. The muscles scream out in pain, even when stationary. I can't sleep because of the pain. No position will alleviate it. Worse is my thighs and calf muscles.

Today (Thursday). Can't stay in bed. Same muscle pain. Chest now starting to feel ufortable when breathing deeply. In myself, I feel absolutely fine. My head is clear and my mind perfectly active. I feel I could do a day's work if only my body would play ball. 

Throughout all of this, I also infected my wife and baby. Thankfully both fine. My baby developed a cough and a temperature. She wouldn't eat for a day but has recovered now. 

My wife had, and still has the temperature. She has zero other symptoms though. She must be immune somehow.

2070,"Online school sucks. My entire school is online this semester and I hate it so much. I feel so terrible every day. Everything about this situation is horrible.

First off, I have so much trouble focusing during class. I've tried everything- creating a separate ""work space"" in my room, taking notes of everything the professor says, putting my phone at the other end of the room during class: none of it works. My mind always ends up wandering and I can never pay attention. I didn't have this problem at all when I was at school.

My friends that I made at school last year and I don't really talk online much, and when we do facetime or whatever, it never feels the same as real life and it just leaves me feeling empty. I have two friends from high school that i still talk to, but they don't really talk to me when they're at school because they have friends they like better. I feel so lonely.

All of my professors so far are talking about things that they used to do with their classes, like field trips, guest speakers, etc. and how we're not gonna be able to do those things. I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of big experiences for my major. This semester is the most intense one for my major as well (I already have four big projects assigned to me) and I don't have access to any of the labs or materials I would have been if I was on campus. I'm afraid my portfolio is going to suffer because of it.

All of my professors and the people in my classes are so nice, and I’m never gonna have the same connection I did with them if I were on campus. I doubt they’re gonna remember me when we go back, and I go to apetitive school where networking is important. And honestly, I just like school and talking to my professors and it’s just not the same.

Also, i just miss being on campus. I miss having independence. I was going to school in my dream city, it was such an amazing place to be. I was able to walk out of campus and basically do anything I wanted to do. I also had a lot more freedom to express myself in the way I wanted. Now that I'm at home, I have no freedom at all.  I can't dress the way I want, or even cut my hair the way I want. I can't do anything without asking my parents first, and it fucking sucks. I'm stuck in the closet as well so I can’t be who I am at all.

I've cried every day for like the past couple of days about it and I just feel so overwhelmed. I fucking hate this so much. I wish I just would've taken a gap year or something, even if that would've put me a year behind my friends.  My mental health has beenpletely spiraling since the beginning of COVID and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.",246,0.98,ipgo5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ipgo5r/online_school_sucks/,30,Support,2020-09-10,-14,129,-0.10852713178294573

\*\*\*

Hi, I grew up with hippie activist parents, and we were low-key preppers. Because of this I have done zero shopping for the COVID19 pandemic. We just already have everything on hand.

To try and help people, I wanna share how we live at my house, and how we shop.

Step 1 - don't freak out and go grab everything all at once. The supply chain in most places is not screwed yet, there will be food arriving for quite some time. It also promotes un-needed panic to see carts overflowing with hoarded food and empty shelves. ""Why should I care if I get mine...?"" Well because if you provoke a panic in a grocery store, you may NOT get yours. Also, if others panic and go into selfish mass hoarding mode, there may be no ""yours"" left to get!

Step 2 -instead budget between $5 to $20 each shopping trip. In our city most places stock overnight and get raided like crazy in the morning. So plan to send a family member as the store opens, before work. Each of you can prevent panic-provoking by splitting up and checking out separately. So if you want 5 bags of dry beans, you get 2 and your spouse gets 3 in a different line. Please be socially conscious and do this, it really does help.

Step 3 - each shopping trip, have 2 lists - one of the perishable things you'll use in the next week, and a ""stock up"" list that you won't use at all, until needed. Budget that extra $10 or so, to grab stuff on the stock-up list.

Step 4 - here's what we keep on hand, as a general rule. ! gallon cooking oil, one can crisco, one box iodized salt. Assorted herbs and spices. Lots of garlic powder and hot pepper flakes -natural preservatives that also kill some bacteria in food.

2 containers boullion cubes. 25+ lbs flour, cornmeal, dried mixed beans, and rice. A month's meals worth of dried or canned veggies. Canned or powdered milk. Canned meats. Whole wheat pasta. 5 lb bag of baking powder from Sam's, and baking soda. Cream of tartar.

&#x200B;

Eggs, which will keep a month in the fridge. Will keep much longer if you rub their shells with lard and bury them under a layer of salt in your pantry. Old pioneer ""no refrigerator"" trick. Get a couple gallons of food grade vinegar - apple cider and white both. Not only is it a good preservative, it's a badass cleaning and laundry cleaning product.

If you have fresh veggies about to go bad, STOP WASTING THEM. Every single veg can either be cut thin and go into the oven on a tray with some salt, to dehydrate, or go into a jar and have boiling salted vinegar poured over them, then put in the fridge as refrigerator pickles.

Get some borax and washing soda, and bulk bars of dial soap. Not only is it cheaper to stock up on than detergent, it disinfects better and you can make 5 gallons of detergent from 1 bar of soap, 1 cup of soda, 1 cup of borax. 17 cents a gallon cost to you.

Step 5 - learn to cook pioneer one pot meals. [All]( has plenty of recipes. You can DM me for my crock pot recipes. Don't go buy a pressure cooker or instapot if you don't already have one. You'd be better off to get a cheap crock pot and a food dehydrator. Although you can dehydrate foods and make jerky in a 200F oven easily.

Don't be intimidated by learning to cook. Homemade gravy is fat, flour, water or chicken broth or milk, some meat crumbles and black pepper, and a spoonful of cornstarch if you're in a hurry; a bit of stirring and bam, gravy. Even lumpy beginner-made gravy tastes goooood.

Learn to make 5 ingredient bread. If you DM me I will set up a video call on discord with you and walk you through it, if that's what it takes :)

Soak beans and rice overnight and give the water to your houseplants or garden, before cooking. The grains will cook faster and more tender, and the beans will be de-gassed. Rinse before cooking, then fill with an inch more water than rice or beans and simmer on the stove or crock pit  til tender. Ham, onions, canned crushed tomatoes, some canned lil smokies sausage... mmmmm. One pot to clean, heckin good healthy filling food.

You can get so many of these ""staples"" for SO MUCH cheaper than pre-packaged, pre-processed foods.

Now, about toilet paper. Don't bother. Go to Lowe's or Home Depot, and get a 5 gallon lidded bucket for each bathroom. Get bleach, ammonia, or peroxide. Buy squares of cloth. Could be washrags, ""shop towels"" or ""dust cloths"" - you want a woven cotton thing happening here. No plushy texture synthetics. You can also just cut up old t-shirts. Or if the hoarders have hit, go to a craft store and get cotton t-shirt fabric. Make a ""diaper pail"" of a bucket filled 1/2 way with bleachwater, ammonia water, or peroxide water. DO NOT MIX ANY OF THESE CHEMICALS, PICK ONE.

Get a spray bottle and put water, 1 drop of dish soap, 1 spoon of witch hazel. When you go bathroom, spray off your undercarriage then wipe with a damp cloth. Cloth goes in the lidded bucket. Once a week, dump the bucket into the washer with a 1/2 cup of bleach and run it on heavy duty. You never see, smell, or touch anything icky. I grew up this way and we went back to in in 2020 on New Year's to help #teamtrees. Once you get past the mental block of it, you may never go back.

I grew up in a literal pioneer log cabin, gardening, raising egg and meat birds, milking dairy goats. I still live partly that way. We went shopping once a month and barely bought anything. If you want to know anything about prepping as a low key, chill, non-panicky set of small lifestyle changes you can slowly make one at a time, AMA inments or DM me.

You can and will get through this.",244,0.98,flnnwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/flnnwp/under_50_nonperishable_pantry_shopping_list/,91,NA,2020-03-20,-18,507,-0.03550295857988166
2073,"My uncle's gone. Hey... I've posted before here, about the ups and downs of my uncle's suffering with COVID, and it breaks my heart to report he passed away today. The doctors said he'd be bedridden for the rest of his life if he survived everything, and it's just not the life he'd want. He was on-the-go and social, so he would never want to just be stuck. They took out the medical supports he had and he went very quickly.

He was such a good, pure person. Like, I know viruses have no preferences but they couldn't have picked a worse person to take from the world. And I know I'm biased but he just was always helping people, always kind and sweet and funny and-- god, I'm going to miss him so much.

Then there were concerns about immunity, turns out long term immunity is likely: [  Even the man in Hong Kong who got reinfected turned out to be asymptomatic.

Lastly, there was concern about recovered patients getting heart damage which scared the crap outta me. Turns out that study was bogus:  [

I am going through a shift of thinking that I hope might help anyone else living/caring for seniors they love and adore. When I started quarantining with my elderly mom, I quit my job, 100%, to keep her safe. I had it all worked out. My intent was to bunker down and take care of whatever she needed as we ride out the storm. I had groceries delivered (which she wouldn't eat) so I'd angrily drive her to Target for weekly, unnecessary visits.  There was really no reason for her to leave the house except for fresh air. Perfect, right?

**She is safe.**

She did do a lot I asked (okay, begged) her to do.  Wearing a 2ply cloth mask, going to the store early (man, are we Target's number one customer!), washing her hands for two seconds (my little timer I bought was another bust.)

Today, after four months, she finally came to me and, with tears in her eyes, said she wanted to get her hair done.

Then it hit me. What a selfish asshole (sorry but no other word for it) that I've been. I haven't been overtly so, I'm not a monster, but I realized that I'm just clinging on to my mom in total terror of losing her. I don't want to lose her to something as stupid as a perm. She wants a perm! But all I've seen is my point of view in this. My selfishness towards this sweet, dear woman while failing to see how she has been quietly suffering.

**She is in prison.**

Who am I to tell this brilliant, vibrant woman, who has survived into her 80s without my help so far, how to live her life? She is cognitive, she is aware, she knows the risks. She has lost so many people in her life already. She understand mortality more than I do. When you are closer to it, you tend to be more chill about it.

Today, seeing her face, how sad she looked, I realized much of the gloom and doom has been in my head. How absolutely humbling. Yes, there is a risk. As there is in everything. I'd LOVE it if she didn't go.

And the hairdresser is doing what he can, seeing one client at time, but they are also good friends. When my dad died two years ago, she was getting her hair done and he was the very first one that reached out to hug her first.  She misses her friend.

She has a right to live her life, to mitigate the risks, to be careful in hermunity but also to make her choices without me having multiple panic attacks and stomping around like a baby. Because you know what? Panic attacks are my problem, not hers.

She's a survivor. She knows she has limited time, virus or not. If she wants to get her damn hair done, especially as responsibly as possible, then get her hair done.

So I'll probably cry myself to sleep, no joke, imagining various worse case scenarios, all of them horrific and in great detail. Again, MY problem, not hers.

Next week, I'll wash her face mask, drive her to the hair salon and wait outside as she finally gets her hair done and hugs her old friend.

This is what you do when you love someone.  You get over it and respect their choices.

And, honestly, I can't wait to see the smile on her face when shees out of the salon.

Just my two pennies today. Hope all is well with everyone.",229,0.94,hwnjtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hwnjtv/are_the_elderly_people_in_your_life_driving_you/,64,Support,2020-07-24,-19,179,-0.10614525139664804

2085,"September marks 1 year in quarantine for my family Long story summarized; my daughter was born very premature at 29 weeks. Weighed 2 lbs and 1 ounce and spent 2 months in the NICU beforeing home. She is overall very healthy except the few times she has been sick we end up back In hospital. Her lungs were the most effected from her prematurity and her doctors have told us that it is Imparitive she doesn’t get influenza or other illnesses that can cause respiratoryplications. 

I gave up my career to provide childcare and keep her out of daycare where she could be exposed to an illness. The mrs. makes much better money than I and it was an easy choice for us. Last summer we were able to spread our wings and let our child venture out in the world. As the cold/flu season set-in we started out “winter quarantine” back in September of 2019 in hopes thate spring 2020 we would be able to go back out in the world. 

Then the coronavirus happened..... and we’re still in quarantine as we approach one full rotation around the sun not really having left our home or having any close human contact. 

For us, coronavirus was an extension of what we already had in place. We get all our food and supplies through the mail. We get all our diapers and wipes through the mail. We grow our own food and have had to build a small “homestead” to support and feed ourselves the things we cannot get. 

I see a lot of people struggling on here dealing with the distance coronavirus makes for some of us. And trust me, I can relate.  I think it’s been getting harder for us as we approach the one year mark knowing it may be another year and hopefully just another six months. We’re trying to not lose hope and trying to stay as pre occupied here at home as can be to pass the time. 

As the summer slowly fades away and recognizing, “yea we missed it this year”. We’re trying to stay positive and financially afloat.  

The side effects from long-term quarantine are real for us. The wife has severe PTSD anxiety from all this including Frequent Panic attacks, irritability, uncontrollable bi-polar mood swings (pre existing). 

I on the other hand I find myself bored all the time, and now having trouble sleeping. I’m up all hours of the night dreaming of what I will do to keep myself busy. Then never gain the energy to begin it. When I do fall asleep I dream of social interaction. Just talking to someone fact to face or going to the store for much needed food. I’ve lost 15lbs since the start of all this so my family can have 3 meals a day each. One meal a day for nearly a year has taken its toll of me and I now weigh less than I did as a teenager. 
 
We aren’t in need of sympathy or empathy right now. My willingness to thrive given the circumstances is reading about the ones still less fortunate than us. We have a home, a garden, clean water, and a healthy family. In many places around the world they are dealing with much worse. 

I am mearly opening up about this to give hope to others who are feeling a bit lost and stressed. My wife and I feel like we’re the only ones doing this. The only ones who are still home. Reading here on this thread often reminds me that we aren’t alone. 

Now it’s my turn to chime in for the others out there like us. Please please please hang in there. After all this time inside we have a found a system in place for safety and we’re not sick. I wouldn’t say healthy because mentally we’re struggling. But we’re alive and the bank hasn’t taken our home yet. We’re mentally preparing for potentially another year of this. I’m going back to school online to stay busy, the wife has been fortunate enough to get remote work to stay busy.  Playing dinosaurs and building block castles with my child has been the life raft of my family. Every time she laughs and giggles I’m grateful it’s not a cough and gasp.

2086,"My husband and I survived 2019 - I feel helpless and hopeless I just need to vent. 

Both my husband and I fought like heck to live through 2019 and for him it carries into 2020. We both left 2019 with scars and then Covid-19 came along. Edit to correct year. 

February 2019 I was induced at 37 weeks with our son due to pre-eclampsia. This pregnancy was anything but smooth sailing. After 30 hours of labor both my son and I became distressed. I blacked out during my c-section and thought I died. I almost did. I ended up with severe blood loss after they were nearly unable to stop my bleeding due to low platelet count. We both survived, I endured PPD but we got through it. 

November 2019 My husband went into surgery to have a large mass removed from his pancreas. They has been unable to biopsy it before surgery. They ended up taking the mass, 2/3 of his pancreas and his spleen. He has an 11 inch scar from breast to navel. He became septic 10 days after the surgery. He went septic 3 more times in the span of 5 months. There were days I really thought I was going to be a single parent. Things started to turn around when they found two holes in his stomach which were causing the sepsis. He had gastric juices flooding his chest cavity. He had a drain for 4 months, came home with a feeding tube but he lived. He cut it close. He lost 5 months with our son. His last stay was 28 days and he was discharged March 13, 2020. 

Then we were put on lockdown. I was kept on pay roll but sent home. I'm a school bus driver so our contracts were honored until June. My husband is an essential worker so 2 weeks after getting home he had to go back to work during this Pandemic. We have been fortunate and I am grateful. But now I've been out of work for two months without receiving unemployment. I probably don't have a job to return to. My husband and I are at risk if we get Covid-19. We have an 18 month old and we've already faced so much together. 

I HATE COVID-19! I hate the lack of empathy people have for those who have died. I hate the self centered people who think this is a joke. I don't know how we can sustain the path we are taking. I feel so hopeless. What will the world look like for the children? I feel like I'm in a bad sci-fi movie. The daily anxiety and episodes of depression.

2090,"Obese worrier with a symptomatic spouse who got some encouraging words from an ER doc - thought I'd share. I remember in March going to the CDC website to learn about this thing and my heart dropping when I read that people with a BMI of 40+ are at high risk.  I had been thinking just the old were at risk and here I am at the age of 31 feeling incredibly vulnerable because I had let my weight out of control and up to a BMI of 47. 


In the following months I've had extremely high anxiety. Everyday I google ""obesity+COVID"" to try and figure out what the science is saying, I dig for local news stories to find young people who have passed away to try and distinguish myself from them, I skim reddit to try and find stories from overweight people who have recovered.  None of these things are helpful and I don't condone any of them.  


What I do rmend is walking. - I started walking daily,mitted myself to getting my 10,000 steps in and pushed for more.  Started eating healthy and doing some intermittent fasting.  I lost 30 lbs in about 2 months - I was ecstatic just Monday I stepped on the scale and realized I was 20 lbs away from being under 40 BMI.

And then My wife started displaying symptoms, and one of her coworkers tested positive.  I felt hopeless - dismayed I couldn't get to under a 40 BMI before the virus came calling, feeling like I'm in for a death sentence if I catch it from my Wife.  I reached out to my best friend who is an ER doc in Chicago and he said the following about being obese:

**""And this is just speculation, but I think there is probably a difference between someone at your weight who is gaining weight and someone who is losing weight. Obesity is a risk factor (we think) in part due to its inflammatory nature, but the physiology of someone losing weight is likely different and I would think they would have a better oue.""**

He didn't give me platitudes, or make assurances that I would have known were white lies.  He told me that what I have already done will likely help.  He motivated me to keep trying to change my physiology.

So if you are like me, obese and obsessing over this online, just try and go for a walk.

2097,"STAY OPTIMISTIC: If China and South Korea are any indications, coronavirus will not last forever Some fearmongers are saying things like ""coronavirus will last forever"", or ""the world is ending"".

It is not.

China has already slowed down coronavirus exponentially. Now there are barely any new cases and there are more recoveries than cases at this point.

South Korea has also slowed coronavirus. There are not many new casespared to last months, and recoveries have also increased past the new cases.

Both were infected in December or January. It is now March. They got over it in two, three months max.

Because they intervened.

It is crucial to remember that the US and other countries MUST do their job if they want to stop coronavirus, lest it cause a catastrophe.

If we want there to be a few thousand cases in the US, rather than a million, we must intervene and cure those infected.

Like I said in my last post, which I actually wrote yesterday, coronavirus will go away on its own most likely, and it'll probably peak here in the US by late April at least, and June at most. May/June is my prediction for the world. I wouldn't be surprised if by then, the news focuses on some other crap like the election or the Olympics (which is also why the Olympics shouldn't be canceled yet, simply because by the time it happens, it may no longer be a major threat). I wish I could say ""this is as bad as its gonna get here"", but realistically, it could reach Italy levels of bad, especially with poor intervention.

The reason China and South Korea have started recovering from coronavirus, and also why Taiwan has fought off to prevent an outbreak, is good intervention. We can't just pretend it doesn't exist and continue to live normal life. We have to wait. I know it'll be ufortable, but if you take good precautions, and try to isolate yourself for the time being (especially if you're in a severely affectedmunity), you will likely not get the coronavirus.

Society isn't going to collapse. Will coronavirus lead to a recession? Possibly, and it's starting to look likely, but if we can stay calm, we can make sure that this isn't a ""millions die"" infection, but a ""thousands die"" infection.

2099,"Is anyone else struggling with people who just will not stay 6 feet away... Everytime I go outside, usually to walk my dog, I see other people out on the street. It seems like very few people bother trying to keep any distance at all. Instead, people march up the middle of the sidewalk and don’t give any indication they’re going to move, so I have to go way around them just to get 6 feet between us.

That would be manageable if that was all it was, but some other people will walk right up to me, or right next to me, without me realizing they’reing (like from behind). And everytime it happens I end up panicking and being more afraid to go out. 

To be clear, it is definitely people who are either not aware of safe distance requirements or who don’t give a fuck who are making it difficult, so I’m not referring to accidentally getting close to someone. 

I know the odds are low that any one person in a brief encounter is going to get me sick, but I’m an asthmatic who is still coughing from a cold I had last month, so I’ve got a higher risk of being a more serious COVID-19 case if I catch it.

Meanwhile, I live with a elderly relative and I've been essentially on lockdown for the past six months. Nothing about my life is normal or OK; it’s a set-up for mental deterioration. When I've met people, they'vemented on how I was ""exaggerating"" and “finicky” for adhering to some amount of physical distancing and preferring an outdoors meeting -- which I thought were fairly reasonable requests. It’s probably not worth meeting people because I’ll instantly get ostracised.

I've been looking for a job so I can move out, but nothing has panned out yet. I feel like employers have expectations that are so out of control relative to the wage they offer. People in Canada are overeducated, so for all I know I’mpeting against BA holders for these min. wage jobs. I was supposed to be studying full-time in the fall. Trudeau promised students that we would get more grants to make up for lost work revenue this year, but because my province manages its own student grant program, the province has instead received the money from the federal government and they’ve been sitting on it since June, not telling us whether they will give it to us and what amount we could expect if they do. We’re in August, I would need to know now in order to plan my finances; it does me no good to announce something in the middle of the fall when I’ll already have cancelled my classes to find full-time work. But I expect the provincial gov. will just divert the money and uni students will never receive anything. The worst is not being in control of the timeline of my life; it's on pause and I’m not the one picking when it unpauses. 

This pandemic affects people very unevenly. I can see how a well-off, healthy couple living in a suburban house with a yard and a pool, working from home, would be relatively nonplussed about the pandemic.

2108,"My Dad, 50yo, 29 days in the ICU and counting. i'm so anxious and scared I'm more of a lurker here in reddit but for the past few weeks, it has been really tough for our family. Maybe talking about it to strangers might help with this crippling anxiety. My dad was a heavy smoker when he was young, but quit fifteen years ago. He got a positive result of the covid swab last month, for a week he felt fine but eventually had to go to the hospital due to shortness of breath. I haven't seen him in a year since my parents live in another country. So when I heard the he was already in the ICU, me and my sister were devastated. But we kept being hopeful and that he would be discharged by Father's day. Not it's already the month of July and my dad's still on a ventilator, still intubated. It kills me to be so far away from him, to have to wait for news about him through my mom who is also struggling with this new reality.

Last week was a good week, we had been told that his overall health is improving and that they'd start weaning him off the ventilator. Yesterday, they finally extubated him on the afternoon. Only to be re-intubated again because his oxygen saturation dropped. His second swab result is still positive. He does wake up from time to time but for the most part just sleeps.

Me and my family are not losing hope, but God it's tough. Really hits differently when it's your loved one that's part of the critical ones.

2112,"A follow up to my post, my 31 year old brother with COVID-19 was given days to live, is still fighting [

This is a follow up to my post. I appreciate everyone who responded, you guys are super awesome and very supportive... Things have gone differently than I expected over the last few weeks.

I went home to see my mom in PA (I know I should not have traveled but it broke my heart to know that she was dealing with this on her own). She had tested positive for COVID about 3-4 weeks ago but was still scared that she could give it to me. So we exchanged sad glances, cried a lot in the same house but not too close together, wore masks and gloves, and talked about my older brother. It was really hard. My mom hasn't cried in a long time, she's had to be strong her whole life (as an immigrant woman) and the possibility of losing her son is really hard for both of us.

My brother has been making very small improvements in his oxygenation over the span of 3 weeks that he has been sedated and intubated. Friday Apr 17,2020 they did a tracheotomy where they inserted the ventilator tube directly into his neck (after surgically cutting his neck open) so that he would be morefortable. It looks horribly painful and I feel awful. I can't imagine how he's going to feel about it when he wakes up. He is making improvements, they put him on the plasma donation list so I hope that he receives the treatment and I hope it doesn't negatively affect him. I feel so guilty not being able to stay home with my mom in PA but I don't have that many vacation days from my job and we are still open (pharmacy).

It's a long road ahead. I can't really get his case manager to call me back about his insurance, he underwent a lot of procedures (ct scans, xrays, surgery, anesthesia, all the drugs he's on) and I need to know if they are billed correctly because he has UMR insurance through hispany. I know money isn't supposed to be important right now, but we're middle class and the financial strain afterwards can be a lot (especially for my mom who has struggled with apulsive gambling husband most of her life).

I worry about his post-ICU recovery. Will he be the same? Will he be able to think the same? I worry that he will have a lot of mental issues in relation to his stay at the ICU. I feel that he might have a lot more depression, anxiety, some PTSD, and I can't even be there to help my mom if he gets upset, hits her (by accident), or my mom or my brother falls down.

Things are looking up (medically speaking) but I still cry a lot and worry about if he could get potentially worse. It's heartbreaking. Everyday I just feel so guilty about all of it and wish this was just some bad fever dream. Thank you guys for reading. I appreciate anyments and sorry for the long time between updates.

tldr; I didn't update a long time about my 31 y/o brother who was given 2 days to live. Went home to see my mom, brother went from ventilator to tracheal tube for ventilator. Things are looking up, worried about continued care, after care from ICU, and bills.

2116,"I really need to vent right now. Sorry if this sounds super bitter. There legitimately doesn't seem to be anything to hope for. The cases are rising, lockdowns are returning, and people are losing their minds again. Even on this subreddit, there doesn't seem to be any good news. There are a million posts about how people are losing all hope for the future, and most of thements just say ""I feel the same way"" or ""this too will pass."" Sure, it'll pass... in 2021 if we're lucky. 

It feels like the past 3 months of hard work, sacrifice, and tears have all been for nothing. We as a people have been told for 3 months to give up our relationships, our jobs, our businesses, our mental health, and everything in between. Our social and mental needs were treated as luxuries that we had to give up to serve ""the greater good."" 

It's a tragic irony to me that the same people who advocated for mental health to be taken seriously before the pandemic, are now giving mental health little to no priority. ""At least you're not on a ventilator. We're all having a rough time. Quit being so selfish."" How's that any different than what people with depression/anxiety have been hearing for years? 

And now that we're seeing a huge surge in cases and hospitalizations, it seems all we did was delay the inevitable. I figured that even if we didn't have a vaccine, we'd at least have a reliable treatment by now. That maybe things would go back to normal. That I can finally live my life without being judged and insulted for it. That this would be like the flu: Still deadly, but now we know how to fight it. 

But every headline I read is about how people are basically dropping like flies and how going outside for something other than groceries spells certain doom. People are demanding that we go back into lockdown, acting as if staying home for 3 months was nothing and we're all just crybabies who don't want to give up ourfort. 

On the other side, you have the people who refuse to take any precautions, who refuse to wear a mask, and who thinks that anyone who listens to the government is a sheep. That the governors who are working themselves to the bone to keep people safe while not ruining their economy are tyrants. They'll fight the idea of having to wear a mask to their dying breath, and then cry ""tyranny"" when the governor inevitably has to close down the state due to rising cases. 

How did wearing a mask be a political issue? What is so hard about wearing a piece of cloth? Why can't these people understand that the longer they resist taking precautions, the longer this lockdown will last? If I have to choose between wearing a mask and being forced back into my home for 3 more months, I'll take the mask any day. 

Idk what was the point of this rant. It's not like things are going to get better because some dude on reddit is angry. I guess I just wanted to vent.

2120,"My state's open...so, I'm still normal, right? I have been out on essential shopping runs a total of 4 times since mid-March. Otherwise, I never go anywhere at all except to and from work, and occasionally an ATM.

Today was the 4th brief errand run: 4th grocery trip, at a store with masks required and other limits. 2nd gas fill up, 3rd pharmacy drive through, ATM.

My state recently opened, too early in my opinion. Traffic today felt like before the pandemic. Parking lots of retail centers were positively slammed. An electronics store I was interested in quickly stopping at for one item had a 60-customer limit, yet still had a small wait outside. I saw that and just drove on! The masks were almost the only hint of things being not 100% normal.

Does anyone else feel weird about suddenly seeing so many people engaged in so much nonessential activity in such crowded spaces, often without masks? When the streets were empty, I felt normal not wanting to be out on them, either; but now I see news segments showing crowded bars in other states? Would it not be *more* dangerous to be out now?  Part of me says I'm still OK for my quick trips for essentials, and that these people are nuts...but of course, while you're out and about, you just see the others who are out, and not the people who stayed in.

2122,"Getting the slow fade from friends who decided COVID was over. I'm still at home and feeling very very depressed and lonely. Warning: wall of text below  


I'm in one of the recent hotspot states (we're currently #1 in new cases worldwide!) and have been at home since mid March, along with my spouse. We are both very grateful to be employed full time and on indefinitely work from home. Spouse has asthma and I have a autoimmune condition that may or may not increase my risk of adverse oues from COVID19 (nobody has studied my condition's COVID oues yet, and I don't take any immunosuppresive drugs besides prednisone).   


During the first 2 months or so of the pandemic, my small circle of 4 close friends and I had twice weekly Zoom meetings. Then two of them started attending BLM protests in May. Another followed suit, and a few weeks later another. As the protests died down a bit, they all started to go out more for other reasons: going to stores (not grocery stores, Marshall's and Target and such), going to Memorial Day and July 4th bbqs, birthday parties, and then bars & restaurants when those re-opened in our state. Now they're pretty much back to living their lives the way they did pre-pandemic.   


Our Zoom chats dwindled when everyone else started going to protests, andpletely stopped happening after the rest of the group decided to go back to normal. I've tried to re-organize Zoom gatherings myself, but the gang either has other plans, won'tmit to a time, cancels last minute, or just doesn't show up. They've invited me toe to their parties, outings, hang out at their houses, etc. I've very politely declined and carefully avoided anything that could sound even remotely judgmental other than the possibly-risky health conditions in my household and been told ""Everyone has to assess the level of risk they'refortable with"".   


We also had a very lively group chat at the beginning of the pandemic that has pretty much died now that the rest of the group is living like it's 2019. I was in a D&D group with 2 of these friends pre-pandemic and we put it on temporary hiatus because 1 of the other group members doesn't have home internet access. I just learned that the group has been playing in person twice a week for the past 3 weeks. I asked one friend why I hadn't been invited back via video chat and was told ""we're meeting at \[no internet friend\]'s house and I didn't think you would be interested in getting together IRL. Plus we started a new campaign and it's really only good for 4 players, not 5."" Ouch.   


I've been feeling very depressed and isolated as a result of this. My only face-to-face human interaction right now is my spouse (who I love, but she's only 1 person). I do have a 45 minute work telephone meeting every week, but it's not the same. For one thing, it's literally over the phone so I can't see anyone's faces. All our groceries and essentials are delivered, contactless, to the house.  


I love my spouse, but she has severe anxiety and I spend a lot of my non-work timeforting and reassuring her (via to be silent hugging, any talking or background noise makes her feel more anxious). She sees a tele-therapist once a week and was making some progress with her anxiety pre-COVID, but all that progress is pretty much gone now. Now I'm starting to feel a little resentful when I know she's going to ask me for silentfort. I kind of feel like afort object and not fully human, a living teddy bear for her to squeeze.   


I always thought of myself as an introvert, but I have suddenly realized how much I need human social interaction on a biological level. I just miss talking to human beings. When I do finally see another human being face to face, will I even remember how to read facial expressions, body language, and tone? When will that be? Months? Years? Are my friends right, should I stop living in fear and just go out with them?  


I've never felt so alone, not even when my very religious parents kicked me out 15 years ago over me being gay. The friends who became my chosen family then are the ones who have moved on now. I feel like the only person who hasn't abandoned me is my partner, but only because of the purpose I serve as afort object.   


If you've read this far, thanks for taking the time. If you know of any online support groups (preferably videochat and facilitated by a professional provider of some sort), please DM me.

2123,"My incarcerated dad just tested positive and I am beyond stressed out My dad has fought hard to keep himself sane ever since he was thrown in prison for something he didn't even do. For years it has seemed like the world has been against him as he's dealt with being attacked several times in prison, having his family cut him off so I'm one of the only people he has to talk to, and dealing with several health issues. Despite all this, he has always been an outstanding father and done everything in his power to be a part of my life despite being locked away. He's a damn hero. 

I was a kid when he was put in, I'm now 22. We had plans to reintroduce him to the world and get him caught up with the things he has been missing. He is eligible for parole March next year. It might not seem that close to many, but relative to how long he has been in and dealing with the hell that is US correctional facilities, it is just around the corner. 

Just last night, he called to inform me he has tested positive for COVID-19. As he is a 48-year-old guy with type 2 diabetes and congestive heart failure, I've been hearing from a lot of sources that the odds are stacked against him. He called sounding like he was at death's door already. 

I feel like everything is falling apart. My dad is my best friend. He has been my only motivation to do anything for the past several years. He has faced several serious health issues in the past and alwayse out on top without any lasting conditions apart from what I mentioned above. I guess it's easy to tell that I'm fearing the worst at this moment.

What I don't know is how his body is going to deal with this or what kind of treatment he is going to receive. The facility he is at is home to the largest number of cases in my state. They refused to test him even when he stated that he had a seriously high fever, was waking up in the middle of the night sweating profusely, had trouble breathing, and was having a severe cough. 

I do know that he has maintained a pretty decent diet and he has kept his diabetes in check quite well, since the only food available to him has made it really easy to do so. As for his heart, I'm not sure. I won't be able to check on him at all until he either recovers or we are hit with grim news since he is currently quarantined and unable to use the phone. 

I'm just so afraid at this point. For years we've told each other to stay strong for the day he gets out, and now it seems like that day might nevere.

2124,"Bad news at the worst time TW; terminal illness, cancer

At the beginning of the Corona pandemic my husband (married for two years, together for about 12) became ill. At first we were worried he had COVID-19 but luckily it turned out to be just a strep throat. However... it didn't go away, also not after two courses of antibiotics. (in the end it took 6 courses of antibiotics!)

Then, on a Friday night two months ago, he fainted when going to the loo. I didn't find him till hours later in a puddle of blood. He hit his head and was very confused. The ambulance came and took him to the hospital where they x-rayed him and concluded a mild concussion and a broken collar bone.

I was relieved to have him back home after that, but two days later his other arm (not the side of the broken collar bone) started swelling up. He went back to the GP and then got referred for a scan and turned out to have both thrombosis and infection in the arm. But on the scan they saw more, unfortunately.  His lungs had spots in them. So they did another scan, this time a PET scan with radioactive fluid and a puncture of the tissue.

When the results came back it was like the world fell apart, he turned out to have final stage lung cancer (adenocarcinoma) which has metastasized to his adrenal glands and neck lymph nodes. The doctor estimates he has between 6 weeks and a year left.

It's hard to deal with that news at any time of course, but right now it's extra difficult. I continuously fear he gets Corona. He has ADHD and autism and forgets to keep distance or to wash his hands. I don't blame him, he really does try, but it keeps me awake at night. He only barely survived that strep throat after 6 weeks of antibiotics.  Every time we go somewhere (we only go strictly necessary places like the hospital) I bring masks and gloves but I'm still so worried. He sometimes scratches his mustache under his mask etc. I do try to keep an eye on it, but it happens so quickly...

Also it's hard when seeking support. All I want to do is hug the kids, or hug our friends (and sometimes I need a hug myself as well!)  but I can't.  I'm so sad over it all. I'm losing my husband, my best friend, and my inspiration...and there's nothing I can do and I can't evenfort the kids and other people who are sad about it.

And then there are people who get on my nerves. You probably seen the type: ""Corona is just a flu"" or even worse: ""Big pharma is out to get you with those vaccines they're developing"". I'm not saying every pharmaceuticalpany has their heart in the right place, bute on, these are the people that are trying to buy my husband some time.

My husband has got one family member in particular, he is into conspiracy theories. The guy can't really help himself and normally I know how to keep my cool, but he keeps on telling my husband how the chemo is bad for him. Also, he says he should eat vegetables only (and just of a certain ph value as well). Tonight I totally lost it. After my husband stating ten times he benefits from the chemo I got so angry I got the phone out of his hands, hung up after yelling at the guy that he has treated exactly zero patients and my husband's doctor has treated thousands. Just before I hung up I heard him say ""but I did research"". After that I cried and cried and hit a hole in the garden table.(And feel ashamed for doing so)

I feel so angry and sad. I just don't know how to deal with it all.

Adding a picture of my husband waiting in hospital this week for the results of blood tests. In two weeks time he gets another scan to see how the cancer is doing.

So sorry for the long and rambling post, I just had to get it off my chest.

2125,"With so many of our lives changing suddenly, I'd like to bring attention to the feeling of depersonalization. [Depersonalization]( is a feeling of detachment. You may have experienced it in an overwhelming, unfamiliar situation or while intoxicated. It's the third mostmon mental health symptom after depression and anxiety. 

It's also thought to be a symptom of anxiety and a self defence mechanism of the mind to protect the individual from trauma, such as a car crash or childhood abuse. Many reported the world around them feeling unreal after 9/11 happened.

You may currently feel the world around you is dreamlike/unreal. You may suddenly feel like you're an outside observer of your body and its actions. You feel numb as the world around you changes instantly.

If you feel this way, please don't panic. It means you're obviously stressed, rightfully so, and your mind is trying to protect you as it tries to deal with the situation objectively. Reach out for professional help, even if it's done remotely. Find something, just one thing, that relaxes you and helps clear your mind like working out or journaling. 

Stay safe and keep busy.

2128,"Does anyone feel like their 60s+ parents became teenagers when this started? So my mom, like most people's parents in their 60s, had a hard time taking this seriously at first. After a few difficult phone calls she finally seemed to get how serious it was, and really understood how stressed it was making me. I live in NYC, and she lives in FL, and it's very hard being so far from her. I got her to get grocery delivery and not leave the house, but the other day she was telling me about going to Publix and CVS, and how safe she felt because everyone had masks on. This has sent me into such a weird anxiety spiral- and I was FINALLY starting to be able to control my anxiety after weeks of it going off the mother-effing rails.

I don't want to keep having the same conversation with her, because she's so stubborn and I'd rather not have tense conversations anymore. In my mind it's just- ya know- stay the fuck in your house forever. She's 67, has no serious medical conditions and is very active/healthy, but she's a smoker and that's what scares me. I'm trying to takefort in the fact that the stores down in Fort Lauderdale don't let you in without a mask, are wiping everything down, that (according to her) hardly anyone was in there, but man that phone call messed me up.

I know I'm probably being kind of silly, I'm sure there is a low risk in that situation but it's STILL a risk. I just wish she was thinking more about the reality of what it would look like if she did get sick.

Neither of them is taking this seriously at all.They both think this is something that's being purposely over-hyped in order to generate fear and turn the US into a police state. My daughter doesn't ever watch movies or TV, doesn't read much,pletely avoids the news. She refuses to talk about anything to do with the corona virus at all. Both of them are believers in conspiracy theories. They aren't practicing any social-distancing.

My daughter works at a small grocery store. She took a few weeks off because she had a lot of vacation time. When she last spoke with her manager, she was told that the employees now had to wear masks at work. She decided to take a leave of absence because she said she refuses to work there if she has to wear a mask (because she doesn't want to play into the atmosphere of fear). 

I feel like I failed as a parent. The most important thing I tried to teach my kids is to always question everything, research everything, think independently; as well as the importance of engaging in civics. In fact, it's my passion. I used to be amunity & union organizer. I've even given a lot of thought to bing a high school civics teacher, because I feel so strongly about doing whatever I can to dispel ignorance, and to help people understand the importance of staying informed and participating in our democracy in order to keep it alive. I've got a wall of bookshelves about politics, history, economics, social justice, psychology, etc. To think that these ""kids"" think they know more (and better) than me is infuriating in itself. 

I've also struggled with depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD all my adult life. Before all this, I had it fairly well under control.

The depression and stress is NOT good for my physical condition either, which is already debilitating as it is. I'm afraid of spiraling downwards. Not to mention, I'm absolutely FURIOUS towards them, and I'm constantly having to ""let it go"" to stay sane.

It's given me a lot of time to think about death and all the philosophy behind it.  I think im starting to get panic attacks about the idea of death and idea of people I love dying. I don't know, im constantly anxious, I feel like I'm going to cry and explode.

&#x200B;

I've never really had issues with mental health this severe before, I just cant stop thinking about nothingness and the void after death or if religion exists will I burn in hell forever. All this empty time is giving me too many scary thoughts and I dont know how I can deal with the panic attacks. I cant even cry I feel empty, hopeless, sad, and this all happens in bursts. Is it because im not drinking enough water? I've had very little to drink and eat recently. I dont know

Is it just me thats feeling this way????

edit: update: I found that talking with my friends and spending my time in thepany of others helps soothe my mind a lot. The anxiety mostly builds up when I find myself alone, I hope everyone can try to keep in touch with other during this time.

Edit 2: A lot of people have reached out to me since I've posted this and I just wanted to leave a statement for those looking for relief and hope. It gets better, I've been doing much much better since the time of my posting. The anxiety attacks are gone, I dont fear the idea of death(well maybe on a human instinctive level) but im doing great, maybe even better than I was before all this. What really helped me was staying in touch socially, confronting the thoughts and doing research, and knowing I wasn't alone in this. 

Personally I've just realized that my fear was mostly just being nothing more than an accident in the universe that will cease and I meant nothing more than that in life and death. I'vee to my own conclusion that there is so little we know about existence, the human mind and itsplexities, and why everything is, toe to such a grim conclusion. As a matter of fact I think its much more likely we're part of something bigger and beautiful, death could just be the beginning of something new rather than the end. Am I saying god exists? No. Am I denying his existence? No. Im just doing my best like everyone else to be the person I can be proud of in life and go into death expecting something new, potentially exciting, and unknown to me.

2150,"As the US election approaches, there is a slew of media attention predicting the collapse of democracy. The constant anxiety over a worldwide pandemic coupled with the (supposed) end of my country, nope. I can't do both. I'm falling apart. First, I'm sorry to add any anxiety to anyone. Never my intention. I'm wired exactly the other way. Helping others always helps me *see* more clearly and, thus, feel better.

Here's my story. Part of my job (I work in msm) means I am exposed to nonstop speculation/articles/on-air segments regarding the declining state of America. They are 'what-if' scenario's related to the elections and are hot right now.

Today, as I was editing yet another end-of-America (and, in this case, the end of the world at large...civil war, social upheaval, stock market crash, a depression, the entire western world dragged down with it) I had had quite enough. I went outside and had a panic attack, first one in a decade. I wanted to smoke. I haven't smoked in a thousand years.

I know the media is a negative, gloom and doom place to reside. It's why I advise people to limit their exposure to keep their own sanity. My motto, just know what you need to know. Turn off the news for a week and you will probably feel like a new person. But I can't. 'Limiting exposure' means missing a deadline and I'm shown the door.

Worse, I was winning the mind game that this damn virus is playing on all of us. Following the guidelines from scientists, taking good care of myself (stopped drinking, exercise daily, meditating), adopting a healthy, realistic mindset, staying connected to my circle of fam/friends. I can get through it, we all can. I'm convinced of this, still am.

But throw in the 'country is over' angle and I'm out. It's overwhelming and I'm thrown down a dark rabbit hole that I'm struggling to climb out of.

The only tiny bit of solace I can find is to realize it's only speculation. The worldwide anxiety is through the stratosphere and the media isn't a bubble. It's just people and that anxiety is going to seep through in the coverage we are all seeing. Fear, panic, sadness, concern, terror, every bad emotion maxed out and, IMO, exaggerated.

So I'm clinging to optimism, trying to detach (music, therapy, laughter). It helps. Thank God for Jazz and Don Rickles.

Is anyone else feeling this or am I just too close to the madness? Thanks for any input at all and, again, huge apologies if this is triggering. Really wicked morning for me and I appreciate you reading this.

But here is a personal bent. I scored a huge win after posting this. After I hit submit, slammed the laptop shut, I zoomed my boss and quit (impulsive tendencies, lifetime problem o' mine). Boom, done, bye. Why quit a job *now?* Because I no longer have an interest in documenting the end of times. Boss told me to take a deep breath and take next week off.

\*\*I hope you read the below because it is now all about you.\*\*

I read yourments and started to feel *connected*. THIS has been a missing piece. I have lost my connection to people, to humanity.  I spent my afternoon, staring at the ceiling while eating tater tots (true story, it's my gotofort food, highly rmend Sonic Burger tots).

Later, with a tum full of taters and energized, I zoomed my boss again. I have been pitching, week after week, for a ""corner of the web"" to cover 'Uplifting Plague Segments'. I know, sounds absolutely wonky, would definitely rebrand that one (!) but, the point, I have been begging for this. Solid no.

Today, realizing I had unexpected leverage, I pitched again to my boss who gave me a green light. This is a huge personal win for me. He is given me a chance to reach out, and work on my baby, my project.  Knowing there is good that is emerging in our collective hardship and confusion. Right here. **YOU are part of the good.**

I should edit the fat off this update. But I'm going to leave it as is because I'm excited and rambling.

2151,"Recovering from COVID-19 (65 years old) I’ve had anxiety issues since childhood, and it was getting out of my control with the emergence of COVID-19. Being in my 60’s, I was convinced that COVID-19 would be my death sentence. Here is my story of getting sick, testing positive and recovery.

With anxiety and seasonal allergies, every post-nasal drip or cough had me convinced I had the virus, and I began taking my temperature anytime I even twitched. I did learn that my normal ranged between 97.4-97.8.

We followed all advice with the virus emergence. Husband and I stayed in lockdown, had groceries delivered etc. I am retired, but spouse started working from home in mid-March. To be safe, we cleaned/disinfected everything that came into the house, or let it sit in the garage for a few days.

I did bike outside, and husband is an avid runner, so those activities continued, but we both kept a safe distance from all other people.

For the record. I was already taking multi-vitamin and Vit D3 supplements. My calcium/Vit D levels were tested in January as part of my routine bone density screening, and Vit D levels were just below the low end of the desirable range, so I started the D3 back then.

In early June I had to go to the dentist. I was having a bad toothache in one of my crowned teeth, and after a week of hoping it would go away (it didn’t), the crown fell off. My dentist had good practices in place:  They wore appropriate PPE, wiped down chair before I got in it, pre-screened patients, had patients wait in car until staff was ready.  Long story short, decay under old crown was fixed, and new crown placed. I sanitized my hands when I left that office before getting into my car.

6 days later… I started feeling sick.

Day 0 afternoon. Started feeling unwell, just overall sick and weak, and with a bad headache and belly pain. Went to bed in the afternoon. No trouble breathing, no loss of sense of smell or taste. Temperature slightly elevated.

Day 1. Woke up feeling miserable with bad belly pain and headache and overall ache. Stayed in bed most of day, getting up only for bathroom and forcing myself to stay hydrated by drinking a lot of water. Convinced self I had a food-borne illness. Temperature was in the upper 100’s.

Day 2. Worse than Day 1, fever up to 101.9. No trouble breathing but did have a sense of being out of breath. Called doctor. Doctor told me to get tested, rest, take acetaminophen, and stay hydrated.   EDIT:  Adding that I was tested on this day.

Days 3 to 5. The worst days. Temperature hit 102.0, and overall feeling awful.  EDIT:  Adding that I received positive result on Day 4.

Day 6. Temperature never exceeded 100.3. Ate some real food but spent most of day reclined and dozing. By evening, I felt well enough to go to my desk and check email.

Day 7. One step forward, 2 steps back. Temperature up to 101.4. Felt like I had brain fog, out of breath, and overall sick. Anxiety flared and I was convinced that I was getting worse and would have to go to hospital.

Day 8. This day was like a repeat of Day 6. Doctor advised that this type of feeling better, then feeling worse was not unusual.

Day 9. An up and down day. I’d start to feel better, then get brain fog sick feeling, sleep for a few hours, feel better, then feel bad again. Fever hanging in the upper 100’s, still feeling out of breath.

Day 10. Temperature never exceeded 98.1. Able to sit atputer for a while. Feeling much better, although still feel very weak and drained.

Day 11. The first day that I felt fairly well, and able to eat some real food. Still very tired and weak, and still feel slightly out of breath. Temperature read 97.9.

Day 12. Woke up feeling good and temperature was my normal  The feeling of being out of breath has definitely lessened.

My takeaways: I got through this at home. \*Anxiety made this worse than the reality for me.\* Yes, it was bad, but not as bad as I previously believed it would be. With all the scary news we don’t hear about the older people (and most other people) that do recover.  I KNOW that the fear and anxiety was debilitating.

This virus can present in many ways. I never lost my sense of smell or taste. I’m convinced I got it at the dentist office, but this can’t be substantiated one way or the other. I guess even with the best of precautions, there are a lot of aerosols in the air from drilling and teeth cleaning in a dentist office.  In retrospect, I should have worn my mask while walking to and from the dentist chair.

I expect to feel tired/weak for a while but will venture outside today for a short walk.  I am now optimistic for a good recovery.  Time will tell if I have any future flare-ups.

We will continue to practice sensible protection measures at home.  I like to think my supplements helped, but I’ll never know for sure. Husband continues to show no symptoms and ran 10 miles this morning. Per doctor’s orders, he will continue quarantine for two more weeks.

One more EDIT: Day 15, start of Week 3.  I'm starting to feel human again, although still weak and tired.  I had a weird fever spike the night before last, and then it dropped and hasn't risen out of my normal range since.  Today I want to eat food!   Husband has remained healthy throughout.

EDIT; Day 17.  I'm seeing some ups and downs.  Temperature is still normal, but I ended up sleeping most of yesterday and just feeling fatigued.  Today, feeling better, but just weak and worn out.  Doctor said that having good days and then a bad day is not abnormal., and has no concerns since my breathing is fine and temp normal.

Day 19.  Temperature has remained normal, but the anxiety...  I still have ups and downs.  I have periods that last a few hours where I feel light-headed and ill again.  Then the anxiety rears its ugly head and I think I'm having some sort of Covid flare-up, and the rational part of my brain tells me it's anxiety, not illness.  Convincing oneself that it's anxiety does not always work, sadly.  My temperature will rise a little bit, but I \*think\* that may be due to anxiety.  I know that anxiety episodes can raise my temperature.  A few hours later, I feel better again.  Doctor is not too concerned about this as long as temperature stays in normal range and I can breathe.  From what I'm reading, it seems there is no universal way that people recover given the information available.  


Overall I am MUCH better than I was during the first 2 weeks.  I'm finally able to eat small amounts of food everyday.   I've lost about 10 lbs., which is good, but NOT a good way to do it.  At the worst I had zero appetite and couldn't eat anything, but continued to take a multivitamin and extra Vit D and zinc, as well as drinking a lot of water.",178,1,hg5om6,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hg5om6/recovering_from_covid19_65_years_old/,66,Firsthand Account,2020-06-27,-59,499,-0.11823647294589178
2154,"New England Journal of Medicine - A potentially promising vaccine on a Covid Vaccine. Study was peer reviewed. All otherwise healthy volunteers produced antibodies and it is in the last stage of development. Details inside... Hey guys,

I know we've seen this before, drug trials that show some promise. But this is a bit more, well, everything!

Key findings:

1. All 45 healthy participants (ages 18-55) produced antibodies to Covid after administered the vaccine. They received two doses, separated by a few weeks (haven't read it entirely, news just broke) but, again, induced an immune response in all. 
2. Now entering the third phase which is critical. If successful it will determine whether it is suitable as a vaccine. This trial begins J**uly 27** and will involve **30,000 volunteers.**
3. No *serious* side effects but still not huge fun.  Fever, chills, muscle aches, pain at injection site. But all survived and managed well through these side effects. Sounds like cake next to Covid but that's me.

2155,"My husband has been intubated in the ICU for 17 days and this morning he finally showed some progress I am mostly making this post for anybody who has a loved one who is intubated in the ICU. Last night I was in the depths of despair because of how slow the progress has been since he was admitted to the hospital.

When he first started to get sick, neither of us assumed it was coronavirus. We were obviously very naiive and the fact that the severity of the virus was being so widely downplayed caused us not to immediately seek help. On this note, out of pure luck, nobody else whom we don’t live with has gotten sick or tested positive for the virus. Although I do feel guilty for not isolating him straight away. 

Once he started showing Covid symptoms we took him to the medical centre to get tested. The doctors were reluctant to test him at first because they said his symtoms were not severe enough but after his test results for flu 1 and 2 and strep came back negative they agreed to test for covid. this was two days after he started feeling unwell

we were instructed to self isolate and we adhered to this. a week later we had still not been given the result of his test and in that time his symptoms had progressed to the point where he was running a very high fever and his breathing had be very laboured. this is when his mom and I decided it was time to go to the hospital

Once he was admitted and after hours of waiting the doctor told us he was critically ill. They had intubated him and taken a chest x-ray which showed his lungs were full of pneumomia. This was the moment I first realised how sick he really was

Over the next 17 days he showed very little improvment. His ventilator settings were at FIO2 95 and PEEP 22 for the first 6 days then dropped to FIO2 65 and PEEP 19 for the subsequent 10 days

I was obviously very worried about what being on a ventilator for this long would do to his lungs. I also know that his odds of survival are not great. I spoke to an expert at the american lung association who told me that long term ventilation causes permanent scarring on the lungs and I lay in bed all night without sleeping terrified that his lungs were slowly turning to stone

this morning, as if by some miracle, his doctor called and told me he finally made an improvement. The hospital staff were able to reduce his ventilator settings to FIO2 40 and PEEP 15 with 31 breaths per minute. I realise that these are still quite high settings but at this point I’ll take what I can get. 

As for myself I have not been managing as well as I wish I could be. I am trying to stay “cautiously optimistic” as the doctors and nurses always say but it’s difficult. I cannot sleep without ambien and I’m using alcohol some nights in order to cope. What I really want to say to anybody in a similar situation to mine is this: 

KEEP YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. Your loved one is going to need you when they get out of hospital and you’ll be of no use to them if you’ve gone looney while they were in there.

I’ve stopped drinking as of this morning. The positive news I just got left me feeling totally refreshed. To everybody who is experiencing loss from this terrible disease I wish you peace and LUCK. this virus discriminates... both myself and his mom tested positive and we have no symptoms whatsoever",174,0.99,fx9l5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fx9l5t/my_husband_has_been_intubated_in_the_icu_for_17/,13,Support,2020-04-09,-6,199,-0.03015075376884422

The biggest impact this virus has had on them so far is that they cant have eggs for breakfast. :) We had a huge family breakfast today and it was really nice to see how happy they were to have eggs.

I am proud of my teenage kids. They are taking this in stride and being stoic. The teenagers know I may lose my job, but they know how much emergency fund we have and that I have a life insurance policy in place that will take very good care of them if I pass, and that if I am on unemployment I have a budget set that will allow us to keep house.   I have talked them through how to pay bills and take care of little ones if wife and I are in hospital at same time. I know at that age I was aware my parents could die from just about anything and was sort of ready for it. I see the determination on their faces and realize they have grown up. They are ready.

2159,"The age of paranoia: ate a bag of chips without ""decontaminating"" it, and now I get to live with general anxiety for two weeks! Mostly posting this for the pure absurdity of it all. 

I disinfect everything we buy. Not a crazy routine; spray perishables down with lysol, leave for 5 or 10 minutes, then wipe down and put in fridge. Non-perishables I leave in the garage for 72 hours. Well, I was hungry and had a ""non-COVID"" lapse where I didn't feel surrounded by a virus at every turn and tore into a bag of chips that we got from the store today (curbside). It wasn't until I ate half the bag that I realized I never ""quarantined"" it, wiped it down or washed my hands before/after eating. You try to be *so careful*, but it's impossible to be 100% vigilant.

She hasn't had the congestion as much as the fever. It kills me seeing her so sick. She's not eating much and it worries me.

I am more mild, with a low grade fever thates and goes. I started with a headache and a cloudy head (and the low grade fevers) and that lasted about 4-5 days. I slept through most of that time and I felt just drained. I few days ago the coughing started and the breathing problems. I've been following the breathing technique viral video of that doctor endorsed by some celebs when it flares up and it is helping a bit. Most importantly I'm doing everything I can to keep my airways clear. Hot drinks, Musinex, lots of water, forced coughing and phlegm extraction (hocking a loogie) etc. I make myself eat, but I have little appetite.

She had a test in London last Thursday which was negative. She boarded her plane on Sunday morning and landed here after a 24 hour travel and was tesed again per government protocol.

It was positive. No idea how she got it. If it were in the plane, I don’t think it would’ve been that fast for the virus to be detectable already. This virus is fucked up.

As of this writing, she doesn’t have symptoms. She is currently in isolation in a hotel by the government. 

It’s so stressful to think that anytime now she will develop symptoms. She is a senior and has her own set of health problems. I cannot sleep at night anymore.

UPDATE:

Thank you all so much for the well wishes and messages. I did not expect to receive this much support. You all saved my sanity. Thank you.

It's been more than a week since her results and she remains asymptomatic. She has since been transferred to a government quarantine facility which turns out to be 5-star hotel. I'm glad that our country is doing its best in fighting this virus despite all the challenges and our limited resources. She is schedule to be released on Oct 6 so I hope all will go well.

2165,"COVID-19 has begun to rob me of my hope for the future. I spent the last two weeks meticulously researching my dream car.  I've been eyeing it for some time, and finally found one that fit the bill. I actually went through the process, got credit checked and approved, was ready to sign and seal. The night before, I started reflecting. What the hell am I doing? I HAVE a car. It's not perfect, but it does the job. I'm not even driving anywhere right now anyway. The furthest I've driven in the last 4 months was a town over. And the payments on this thing? Monstrous. 

I turned it down today. And I thought, I think the real reason I almost went on this deep dive for a shiny new car is because...I just wanted something to look forward to. Before all this went down, I had started my dream job as a teacher, and had a budding new relationship. I had dreams of growing closer with my girlfriend, doing my PhD, getting more involved in my department, maybe even moving closer to work and getting a place with my girlfriend. 

All that is gone now and 4 months later it really seems to be setting in. She left me shortly after it began, I can't really say I blame her. That's way too much to put on a new relationship. All my work went remote. I'm still getting sections to teach but going online is so different. I'm back living with my parents at 32 which I'm actually thankful for, without them and the dogs I think I would have gone crazy. But it's just tough. It's like all this crap has been wiped, like making progress in a video game and finding out you forgot to save. 

So, I don't know. I want to date, but I can't. (though I am going to attempt to meet with someone who agreed to join me for a socially distant walk on Sunday). I want to progress in my career but it's stalled. I want to move out, but money is sparse and I don't want to bepletely alone.

It can't be confirmed if I can't get tested. I can't get tested because I don't meet the criteria.

Bills keep piling up, especially for renters like us, but there is no relief.  Hours have already been cut because of lack of business, and now the little money that wasing in and barely sustaining us, will have to be cut off so that we can do the responsible thing and stay home. Oh, yea, and rent is due in three days.

All we can think to do is stay inside, pray this passes for us quickly and without one of us requiring hospitalization, hope we can avoid eviction and try to dig ourselves out of debt when my spouse is able to return to work. Then we have to hope that my spouses employer is understanding about the time taken off and does not cut hours further.

Stanford University has a program, that uses yourputers processing power, to help research possible ways tobat COVID-19. It is also simulating things tobat other diseases, but right now they do a lot of research specificly regarding COVID-19.

To find out, what they are doing exactly, check out this article:

If you would like to support them, download Folding at Home via this link:

Just install the program and it will run in the background on your pc :)

To control how much processing power it occupies, use this client:

Set this web control client to ""I support research fighting: Any disease"" this will include the novel coronavirus.

You do NOT need a high end pc to do this, ANY pc will do :)

I was really happy about this, since I felt like there is literally nothing I can do against this virus, but it turns out: I can do something :) Well, my pc does the work, but still :) Hearing it work, reminds me that I am actively contributing to research, which is a great feeling :) I know, I am making only a small difference, but still, it is a difference.",156,0.99,fjr906,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fjr906/i_found_out_i_can_help_with_covid19_research_and/,21,NA,2020-03-17,4,65,0.06153846153846154
2181,"Frustrated with hearing “quarantine to be safe.” I work a low-paying, shift-oriented, Mon-Fri, 8-5 job, working with infants and toddlers. I’ve been experiencing cold symptoms the last few days, as I do almost monthly, pandemic or not, because my little ones are walking (and crawling) petrie dishes. Every day, I psych myself out and convince myself I have covid. I can’t tell if my chest tightness is a symptom or straight up anxiety/panic. My sinuses go from clear to stuffed in a matter of hours, multiple times a day. My hair is long and curly and heavy and gives me headaches... but it could also be covid. I cannot keep up. The only thing keeping me slightly sane is knowing I can still regularly run a 9 min/mile, 4-6 miles at a time. 

I have been doing some reading on peoples’ accounts of having the virus and when I see uncertainty about whether someone has it or not, I see “quarantine to be safe” as support or direction. 

I. can’t. afford. that. 

I can’t do my job from home. My job had a grant to pay people who needed to be out to get tested. Keyword *had*— the grant expired last week. I’m tired of hearing “quarantine to be safe!” from people who can work from theirputers and send emails and have zoom calls and still get paid. My state has been taking 10-12 days to return test results and if I left work to get tested, I wouldn’t be able toe back unless I had negative results. That’s potentially a whole paycheck I wouldn’t get. I get 1 (one) paid day off a month. I only have 3 as of now. 

Just like every other American, I have to get paid to live. Rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, gas... I can’t just “quarantine to be safe” and not work and not get paid. I’m trying my very best to wash my hands, wear my mask, keep my distance from my coworkers and my family and my roommate. It’s all I can do, yet I’m constantly feeling the guilt and pressure from people saying “Stay home! Quarantine! Think of your grandma!” 

I need some reassurance that I’m doing all I can do with my circumstances.

2186,"My hopefully reassuring experience I felt the need toe on here and provide a positive firsthand account, because while I find these valuable it seems many are just pumping up the panic instead of offering support or positive thoughts or even remotely typical experiences. 

I had covid in March. I have asthma but otherwise am healthy, and I’m pretty young. Truth be told, I wouldn’t have known I had it if I had not had a friend juste back from Italy that ended up sick. It started with difficulty breathing. Nothing awful, it was noticeable but I was still working out at home doing intense HIIT and was fine. Did need to use my rescue inhaler more, but it never felt scary or anything. Then a couple days later I developed a dry cough, not too bad just a bit annoying. That same day I developed a mild fever, just under 100°. It went away with ibuprofen and only lasted a day. I had some minor body aches that day and the next and then they went away. The cough cleared up after a week, the difficulty breathing continued for a few more weeks, but it never got worse or anything. I used a nebulizer and was fine, still continued my workouts at home. I have had colds that were far worse and messed me up for a longer period of time. I have noticed my allergies have been worse this summer, not sure if there’s a relation or not. I tested negative 3 weeks after initial onset of symptoms, but that was the only subsequent test I had so I would likely have tested negative sooner than that if I had gotten one.  I had an unrelated lung scan a few weeks ago and my lungs are wonderful and clear, and the “permanent damage” they told me I’d have after a nasty virus 3 years ago ispletely gone. 

This isn’t to say everyone’s experience will be like this, but I feel these stories need to be shared. We are constantly having the “30 year old dies after partying” stories shoved down our throats, yet none from the loads of people who have recovered just fine, which are the vast majority. Moral of the story: be cautious, do what you feel you should to be safe, but know that typically people are not experiencingplications or even requiring healthcare for this.

2198,"Remind me I'm being smart My fiancé and I were in a wedding this weekend, and it went on as if COVID was not happening. No masks, no signs about social distancing, anything. Masks were required in the church, and people still refused. My fiancé and I wore masks and tried to stray from others, but EVERYTHING was inside. Dancing, eating, socializing, the works. Also, the bride AND groom's families do not think COVID is real (there were about 85 people in total). All in all, it could be described as a ""perfect"" wedding (despite putting people's health at risk).

On the other hand, in two weeks, my fiancé and I are getting married (if we are still COVID free). The only reason we are having a ""wedding"" is so that we can live together (we are Catholic, so we need a sacrament in order to be married). Everyone will be wearing masks at all times, socially distanced, and there will be no reception. Also, it is only close family and the bridal party attending. Everyone, including my family, is giving me crap for not doing a more ""traditional"" wedding. All my friends say they feel so bad for us because it's sad we cannot do anything ""fun."" By that, they mean no first dance, bouquet toss, drinking, etc. (also, we cut our guest list from 300 originally, so the day was going to be a lot different).

My fiancé and I are happy with receiving the sacrament, then going home and being alone until all of this is over. But sometimes my family and friends make me feel like the world is ending just because I am forfeiting those traditions. They have made me cry, and continue to make me cry, on a daily basis. Honestly, I just want them to see that I am happy being married, and that is all I want. I was sad about the traditions, but now I do not care. It's just a dance, and just food, and just pictures.

The first thing I did after getting through a really hostile, shitty, extremely traumatic divorce and getting the cash settlement from that was surprising my mom with tickets for a trip to Europe. She's never been overseas and was *so* excited to go--but we ultimately had to postpone it due to a major crisis. She works as a professional dog breeder, and a litter of her puppies contracted parvo. Funds we'd set aside for the trip were redirected to emergency vet bills. We planned to go in May of this year instead. 

I booked tickets and AirB&Bs. I planned tons of stuff for us to do. I sent her guidebooks and travel essentials for Mother's Day. My mom and I stayed up until late in the night sometimes just texting back and forth about cool stuff we were going to do. I've been living halfway across the country from my mom for 10 years now, and this was the first time I felt like we were really bonding as mother and daughter.

The important things are still true. My mom and I both have our health. And for the time being, we were able to get refunds on the AirB&Bs and credits for the flights. And I wouldn't trade the way we've connected over this trip for the world. But it's just kind of sad to think we could have been exploring Paris together today. She wasn't too upset about having to postpone, but I know she was disappointed. She admitted to me that she was starting to worry that we'd never get to go. I kind of worry about that too.

While I've been delving into freelance voice over work and other creative pursuits, she's been nothing but supportive and encouraging, and always quick to tell me she's proud of me.

She resents me for having mental illnesses and is having a hard time abiding by 'household rules' that make me feel safe during this global pandemic (such as, ordering groceries instead of going to grocery stores, not getting take-out food, no hanging out with friends, no getting hair/nails done, etc). 

She thinks that my fears are beyond 'normal' (hint hint, they are, I fucking have OCD), and throws my mental illness in my face every time she doesn't get her way.

My husband's family is huge. Absolutely massive. It is a far cry above what my family is (3 people left on my mothers side. Total.) So it was really a huge and lovely shift to be around such a diverse family. 

Yesterday, I was approached by a cousin, who asked if I had the provincial tracking app. It's an app for monitoringmunity spread, which tracks your location and any interactions with potentially sick people. If you be sick, they will send an alert to anyone who was physically close to the person in recent days. Since I've been working the entire time in an essential industry, I was required by my employer to have this. I didn't mind. I have a phone and FB, so its not like my whereabouts and activities are a huge off-the-grid secret. 

Cue cousin asking me if I had the app. Strange, but okay. I said I did, we use it due to being essential at work, etc. 

I was then asked to delete all information related to the extended family. Remove all contacts, all phone numbers, all photos, and all social media connections related to the family and then I would be blocked. 

I laughed. It must be a joke, right? 

Nope. They were serious. They believed this app was the beginning of a dictatorship, that they were monitoring our 'every move' and seeing who I interacted with in my daily life (yeah because me going between home and work is definitely government-monitoring worthy), and that the app would use that information to strip them of their freedoms. 

I told my husband, who made some calls to the family. After a little while, hees back and he is pissed. Tells me to just block and delete those idiots for now. So I spent over an hour going through my social media, blocking and removing everyone who had a problem with me having this 'dictatorship app'. I've been told to also stay away from them, their houses and our local coffee shop.

A few relatives called me as time went on, saying they weren't part of that nonsense. 

This is the stupidest thing ever. They all have social media and smart phones. Yet this is the app that is tracking their personal information... through my phone *hunting* their phones down and *spying* on them.

2219,"Feeling like one of the only people taking this seriously anymore... I (25F) live with my high-risk mother and stepfather. About a week ago, I was told about the possibility and likelihood of me having mild asthma. As such, I may or may not be at high risk as well. Many of my family members and friends are doing risky things. There are some that are still taking some degree of precaution, and then there are others who are acting like this is over. The only people that I don't live with that I can trust are my dad and my oldest brother.

My younger brother keeps going to dance parties where he is in constant close contact with more than 10 people. He currently lives with my high-risk uncle who also doesn't seem to take it seriously as he doesn't believe the data surrounding this virus.

A few days ago, I had found out that my oldest brother and sister in law are planning on attending their friends' wedding next month, where there will be supposedly 40-50 people. My oldest brother said that they will require masks and attempt to practice social distancing, but in my opinion, it is still unnecessary contact with others. Not to mention, they have still been going to restaurants periodically--meaning dining inside. After the wedding, I am not planning on hanging out with him for at least 2 weeks after.

The friend that I wrote about here before is still not taking precautions--going on vacations, hanging out with people who don't live with her, not wearing a mask or socially distancing. As I have stated, I probably won't be hanging out with her again until this is all under control.

Now, a few of my other friends from college are planning on hanging out tomorrow by going to a bowling alley and to a seafood restaurant (more than likely dining inside). As soon as I heard this, I instantly noped out of that.

As much as I want to go hang out with friends sometimes and act like things are normal, the fact is that this is not over. While I sometimes get bored with being cooped up at home all day, I would much rather be bored than to be hooked up to a ventilator--or worse of all, the potentiality of my parents being hospitalized and not being able to visit them.

2221,"Feel like I'm going crazy. The case counts don't make any sense in Texas, people are acting like things are normal where I am... I own a small business in a small town in Texas. My business (food service) is considered essential under the guidelines, so I've been open all this time. It's a food trailer, so it's take-out by design. I take all the precautions: mask, gloves when serving curbside, I've closed our courtyard to customers, people have to wait for me to bring their food to them contactlessly, no cash, on and on.

As it's been with all other restaurants, I've taken a hit in sales. It's been rough, ngl, and I want this all to be over as soon as possible. But we can't fucking do that when people are roaming around as if it the world was the way it was before all this shit started.

I feel like Texas has been under a blanket of false security. Our case counts have been relatively low, especially for our population. Some of this is due to early action that cities like Dallas and Austin took, but Houston -- as far as I know -- was late to the game. We're at the very bottom in terms of testing. For the longest time, there was no testing in my county, and then there was testing for those who were ill enough to be admitted into the hospital. And just recently, we got a mobile testing unit from the Texas National Guard, but you still have to get screened. One other independent testing site has been set up, but it's only a couple of days out of the week for a short period of time, has limited hours and your doctor has to make the appointment for you.

So almost no one, in the grand scheme of things, has been tested. But the government is running around saying how well we're doing. I am almost positive those who have the coronavirus, but aren't being allowed to be tested, are just being sent home, so we have no clue how many people could be hospitalized but aren't being. And none of this is getting reported in the media. A study from UT was just released saying that we've hit our peak, but, again, without a proper testing regime I don't know how you can make that assumption.

And it's on all of these bases that the state is deciding to reopen. We had the dumbass protesters in Austin. There are restaurants in the state which are re-opening for dine-in service on their patios, which is infuriating. Ever since the beginning of this thing, people haven't really been taking the shelter-in-place orders seriously. The grocery and hardware stores are fucking packed, no one is standing six feet away from each other, almost no one is wearing a mask, etc. etc.

I feel like I'm going fucking crazy. Our data does not match the data for other states in a similar situation. But part of it is because we just don't have good data, and there's been almost *no fucking effort* to report good data. We should be closed. Or maybe I'm overreacting and everything is actually fine and for some reason, despite the fact our response has sucked on all fronts, Texas is really just a corner of the world where the virus isn't that big of a deal. But I have no reliable information to go off of that says this is the case.

2222,"This pandemic ruined a budding relationship and I just wanna rant about it Met a girl in late February. We started talking, basically nonstop. Felt like we were hitting it off. Mid-March, after some deliberation, I pushed the ""do we like each other"" issue. We did. After that, we hung out basically once before COVID came to the forefront and locked everything down. At first we said we were gonna try to make it work. She seemed as enthusiastic as I was. I was scared about being on lockdown for awhile and not seeing each other, but I wanted to make it work. I thought we could. Late March, I guess a switch flipped for her. Said she was scared of getting into a relationship due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, and she's also starting a stressful new job in mid-May and is afraid of what her availability will be. Legitimate concerns. I don't blame her. Things are stressful. We said that maybe we'll reconsider continuing it when things get back to normal (I feel like these kinds of things never pan out, but I suppose this is particularly weird time) and made promises to remain friends (which has gone about as well as you'd expect; we ping each other here and there but it's super awkward).

And she's right. I can't fault her. Trying to navigate a new relationship right now would suck. But having it ripped away from me sucks too. I really liked this girl and I feel like my chance of getting a fair shot was ripped away from me through no fault of my own. I struggle finding people I really connect with, and this stings. The timing has beenically bad. It's hard not to be furious about the situation.

If things were ""normal"", I would've been able to wallow in self-pity for a little bit, but then get back to normal life and do things to distract me. Now, I'm just stuck in a house and I've been totally unable to get this off of my mind. It's been awhile now so I don't really feel sad anymore, I just feel empty. I hate how nebulous everything feels. When can I see my friends again? When can I resume some semblance of normalcy? Is there actually going to be a time when I can attempt to rekindle this? Generally it helps me in life to pick something in the future and look forward to it, whether it's a big event or just hanging out with friends the next weekend or something. But with so much uncertainty it doesn't feel like I have anything to look forward to. It's just me, alone, working and killing time until I have to work again, indefinitely.

I consider myself overall lucky in this pandemic. I have a good job where I've just gone full WFH. I don't have economic concerns or anything. I'm lucky to be well off in this respect and I'm grateful for that. I still really hate this. I hate how I've had a potentially good thing ripped away from me, I hate how little control I have over my own life right now, and I hate how uncertain my future looks.

Believe me I tried camping and hiking it's not for me. I am a big city person and love going to new cities all the time. I know people will say ""but you can still visit them!"" it's just not the same. I have anxiety anytime someone evenes close to me. I get anxiety in stores that I am always looking around to see if someone is going toe into contact with me.

2229,"Have to Accept the Consequences of Choosing Physical Health This morning, I had my bi-weekly tele-health appointment with my therapist and, without much surprise to anyone here, our sessions since March have been primarily trying to address my mental health decline related to the pandemic.

On today's call, my therapist explained that I have to accept the consequences of choosing my physical health/safety including the negative consequences such as continued isolation which is directly impacting my mental health. Accepting the consequences is an act of acknowledging what I can control (myself) and trying to not let what I cannot control (other people and their actions) so directly affect my emotions and mental state.

Have read many posts here, and can empathize entirely, over the frustrations of others acting recklessly as those of us trying to act responsible are often left with the additional burden of isolation, anxiety, and depression but as difficult as I think it will be, I believe that I need to shift my focus on the matter and acknowledge that it is my choice to place my physical health/safety and what others do is on them.

It is time that I take back what I feel like others have stolen from me and work harder to find ways to be social without putting myself at risk. I have chosen to be physically distance so I am the one that needs to put in the effort to make connections with others as safely as possible.

I lost my job due to the pandemic, live 600 miles away from my family, and have struggled with mental health issues for years. As I’m sure many of you can relate, I’ve never felt this bad.

I feel like I’ve lost all sense of meaning in my life. I don’t have any goals to strive for because everything is up in the air. I’m supposed to graduate early this December, but I’m unsure if classes will even continue in the fall if the situation doesn’t improve. I’m a student studying the music industry, which is already an uncertain field that relies on internships and experience. I have spent the last summers doing these internships and making meaningful connections that would help me in my career. However, there’s no chance of doing that this summer.

I’m just unsure where to go from here. I am without a job, finished with school for the summer, and without internship and career opportunities. My house lost power due to a storm this past week for 4 days which made the situation even worse.

I hate to sound whiny and pessimistic, but I’m so lost right now. I feel stuck. I’m not getting out of bed unless I have to. I’m neglecting my needs and I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so depressed. If anyone has any words of advice I would appreciate it so much.

2242,"Losing Hope Living in the US, I just don't see us getting out of this. I'm wondering what the point is of even being alive if things continue this way. It feels like this is just how we live now or at least for the next few years. I think I'm honestly at my limit. I have no hope anymore, not an ounce, not a shred.

I spent last summer in a depressive slump over an ex friend of mine. Now it feels so fucking ridiculous inparison to what's happening now. I wasted that summer. I did absolutely nothing. I could have been traveling or going to the beach or anything... just anything. I could have gone to a convention, seen friends. And now I don't know if there will ever be another one.

I thought there would always be a next summer, and then there wasn't. Is there a point? Is this living? In the US is this ever gonna get better? I don't have any hope at all. I've given uppletely. Don't tell me to turn off the news. I've tried. It doesn't matter. This is happening regardless of if I'm looking at it or not.

EDIT: To those of youing to harass me, call me a crybaby, pass judgement on me, etc. Please know I am severely mentally unstable and have been for a while. Please also know I do NOT play fair. I have no problem creeping on your post history, and dishing it out tenfold.  I'm in lockdown and don't have shit else to do.

2243,"Everyone/friends acting like there is no pandemic, making me feel crazy??? I'm honestly just looking to see if anyone can relate.

I've been heavily social distancing since March. I'm 27 living in Southern California, relatively healthy, but live with my two immunepromised parents. Mom has Rheumatoid Arthritis, hep C, and is a paraplegic. Dad almost died of pneumonia two years ago, was diagnosed with pre-diabetes and COPD, and they are 62 and 69. I'm an adjunct professor and lucky to work from home. I've been more careful that most: I haven't even gone to the grocery store once or any indoor store since March, everything is delivered, I will see friends outside social distancing no masks if far enough away, masks if in closer proximity especially for long periods of times. No outside dining or anything. Will go for walks/hikes. It's worth it to me to not kill my parents, and I also am seeing a ton of research on long term impacts for young people, and to me it's not worth it to have brain damage or heart issues the rest of my life.

With that being said, I understand that people are not going to be as extremely careful as me, see some family members and a few friends upon occasion or within reason. I'm not sure if it's just here in SoCal, but now NO ONE seems to be social distancing and it is making me feel like I am the crazy one being paranoid even though I know I'm not.

It's my birthday Monday and I tried to go on a hike and have an outside movie night with my projector with 3 friends tomorrow. Out of these 3, two of them couldn'te because they were busy going on vacation with multiple people outside their household. My one friend went to Vegas with about 7 other people, none who live together, most have kids, and she lives with her elderly mother and visits her brother who is HIV+. My other friend is going to Palm Springs for the weekend with a different friend who just flew in from San Fransisco. Her parents are in their 60s and 70s and also not in great health. 

More so, 99% of people on my newsfeed/IG story are out at bars, weddings, huge house parties, and no one seems to think a thing is wrong.

I know friends family members who are young close to my age with no pre-existing conditions who have died as well as students having similar experiences with their family members. My neighbor's entire family got it and they were all extremely sick but they continued to go out immediately  afterward, don't take any precautions and never did in the first place, and didn't ever tell anyone publicly they had it.

My mind is just blown and I feel angry and upset. Particularly at my friends who know better.  I feel like I am doing everything to keep everyone safe and no one else gives a shit and it's depressing. I feel like everyone thinks I am being crazy taking all these precautions when it is literally what everyone else should be doing, and it is taking a toll on my mental health. Can anyone relate?

I keep telling myself, I can only control what I can control, but when my mom is sitting here bawling her eyes out everyday because she can't go out and is depressed, and then I see my ""best friends"" going out all over the place without masks and being careless, being hypocritical, it enrages and frustrates me to no end. I've wanted to yell at them, guilt them, but I know it does nothing and strains my relationship, but I feel like I am losing so much respect  for them over the selfishness of it all. Will I even want to hangout with anyone when this is over? As of now, I feel like I don't and that makes me feel worse because I feel like I'm being judgmental and a bad friend and terrible person.

I know people are human, I know this is hard, and I don't except people to be 100% like me.  I don't expect people to be hermits, or not see anyone at all, but Vegas, boats and gatherings of 10+ people?! You don't need to go to Vegas or out of town with multiple other people who don't ever social distance??  Especially those who live with others who are more susceptible to getting sick. If you live alone or with a roommate and are young and want to risk it to see some friends, I totally get that. My other friend lives alone with a roommate and he goes out to eat at restaurants, sees his friend group a few times a  week, which I totally get and think is fine! But people are the river every weekend with so many other people and it's infuriating.

Just looking to see if anyone else feels the same or is having any similar experiences or feelings because it sucks and no one I know can really relate. My job already said we aren't going back until Summer 2021 in person at the EARLIEST, and potentially Spring 2022. It's not like it's going to get better soon. Are people just going to keep acting like nothing is wrong until they or someone they love gets extremely sick or die?

2246,"Today was the funeral I married into a large family and enjoyed the unconditional love of a fabulous mother in law who always considered me her daughter even when divorce eventually came between my exhusband and me. This beloved matriarch turned 96 last Thursday in the hospice part of the hospital where you go after ICU can’t help you. The ICU couldn’t help her because no family member was able to be there to intercept a doctor so focused on helping that he over-explained where plasmaes from and she refused treatment. Any of over 200 people in the family could have warned him how squeamish she was. She died last Friday. 

I have spent a lot of time texting moral support to my exhusband through all this. This weekend he flew back home for the services and burial. None of this is normal bereavement. He’s having to rent a car, stay in a hotel to reduce his risk of exposure, he’s not able to hug and cry with his siblings over their loss of a truly beautiful soul, he’s had to insist on limits for funeral attendance despite an entiremunity wanting toe together over this huge loss, he has to sit on planes and worry about gaps in people’s masks. And most of all, he wants his mom to have not suffered. We all do. 

It’s not that we thought she would live forever, but she was strong and sharp and we joked that she’d keep going until 113 and then slip away while napping in her armchair after a family reunion. There are no guarantees, but frankly she had enough relatives that we are all in shock that absolutely no family was with her when she was so sick and having difficultymunicating and needing to make living will decisions via phonecalls. 

I’ve read news stories of bereaved families overwrought that their relative died without family on the Covid units, but this past 10 days has made me hyper aware just how cruel that scenario is. My mother in law created a huge family, she dedicated her life to all these offspring and remembered everyone’s birthdays and loved catching up on family news good and bad. She relished Family. And she was there alone - probably the first time in her life she’d been alone. 

It haunts me that she was alone and I know this idea is much worse for my ex husband. This is not what she deserved.

My anxiety is bing barely manageable (2hr workouts only softened it) and I need to find a new place to live in the near future.

I am currently in therapy which helps for a day or two before the existential dreades back.

2250,"My reflections of 2020 and this pandemic During this pandemic, I have begun to fully learn the true meaning of sacrifice. The definition of sacrifice is: ""an act of giving up something valued for the sake of something else regarded as more important or worthy."" Don't get me wrong, I have made small sacrifices before such as forgoing a night out with friends because I had a test to study for or an appointment to go to.

I have never had to give up something significant for extended periods of time until 2020. I have always had a way of feeling instantlyfortable until recently. When this whole thing first started, I was feeling extremely anxious and tense. I felt so out of control. I had no idea what to do or how to cope. I was so unsure about my quality of life and how to proceed.

Then, I realized that I had to getfortable with being ufortable. I also realized that sometimes part of being an adult--and a human being in general--is sometimes doing things that you may not necessarily want to do for the greater good. Sure, I sometimes have moments that I want to go out to restaurants, go on vacations, or hang out with friends. Sure, I have my times where I may be bored of being cooped up at home sometimes.

However, I realize that it is my duty as a daughter, as a friend, as an employee, and as a human being to do whatever is necessary to ensure that my loved ones and fellow citizens are safe. No amount of fun is worth someone I love and care about being infected. 

A lot of the time, I think about my parents and how much they have sacrificed for us children. My parents have helped raise four children for the past 30 years, which meant that they often had to do things that they didn't always want to do. Sometimes, they would go hungry just so we could eat. Sometimes, they would spend literally their last dollar to ensure that we had everything we needed. The way I see it is that if my parents could sacrifice things for me over the past 25 years, then I can stay home for as long as I need to to keep them safe, alive, and healthy.

People may argue that 2020 is one of the worst years ever because of this pandemic and everything drastically changing because of it. For me, in a large way, this year is one of the best years because it has pushed me to get out of myfort zone. It has enabled me to grow in many ways that I never thought I would. It has pushed me to look further beyond myself and towards the greater good. It has gotten me closer to my family. It has challenged me to be more content within myself and learn to enjoy my ownpany without outside distractions.",121,0.96,i7iad7,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i7iad7/my_reflections_of_2020_and_this_pandemic/,13,Firsthand Account,2020-08-11,1,125,0.008

He runs a convenience store. I guess I should say they're in a small town in Kansas that hasn't been affected much. Still, he's taken precautions. Plexiglas between cashier and customer, gloves, constant cleaning - all of it. Since he's been going out, he and my mom are keeping distance from each other this whole time. Honestly, impressive resilience. 
My brother and his family have not been cautious. At all. Continuing with vacation plans in early April, and hosting friends visiting from out of state, among other things. I know where he gets his news, and so as not to alienate anyone in particular, I'll just say that in my opinion, his sources aren't reliable.
So, this morning I call mom, and she says he had invited her and stepdad to an outside bbq, which they attended, doing the best they could to maintain social distancing. In my opinion, that's already an unnecessary risk. But, to top it off, he hadn't told her about his and his family's social indiscretions, and talked her into taking his 3 kids, her grandchildren, home overnight. So, they're there now.

2256,"The Hidden Good Stories Emerging - I have a feel good story to share... I think in the middle of this huge strain it's too easy to forget there is also still good there. I want to add my own story for hopefully a little encouragement.

I live with my mom, who is extremely high risk and frail. We are in Arizona and yesterday it was 114(ish), we are in summer scorching hell. What could be the worse thing in a quarantine? Right, the AC went out. Now we have two life threatening situations and I thought I was going to have aplete break down.

Because the clock starts to tick. Close the windows, open the interior doors, pack your bags. Now what. Are hotels safe? Which ones? How do you know? We have a cat, can't leave her behind, where does she go? Oh, God, wait, what about our two birds? I had to solve this huge stressor and was in zero mood to do so. Tough luck. The problem is mine to fix.

Completely out of desperation I went to..wait, maybe I shouldn't say the name..but an app that connects you to your neighbors. We know a few but mainly these are all strangers. I just threw out the question of a ""safe"" hotel and any idea's for the pets for an overnight stay.

Put down my phone, went back to rushing around. Packed up our car, put my totally freaked out cat in her carrier with no idea where *she* would go, put a washcloth on my mom and gave her some ice. It's surreal packing up quickly without knowing where you are going.

In all this insanity, I suddenly remembered the app and checked for any responses. And I got 'em! I was inundated with people offering portable AC units, an empty condo we could stay at over night for free, food delivered to our hotel, info on nearby hotels, people offering to take in our pets.  You get the idea.

I scrolled and I just cried. I did. I know that 99% of the response  is because I mentioned my mother and that's actually the best part of it. The elderly are suffering so much and strangers out of nowhere and everywhere were offering all kinds of help imaginable.

We ended up staying at a Hilton because I read about their safety standards. And they took our pets! Can you believe that?! I still can't. 

Day later, the AC is now fixed (thank GOD) but I don't think I'll ever forget yesterday and the selflessness and goodness that I saw extended to us. What a gift.  I keep saying to everyone we are in this together and yesterday that was shown to my mom and me.

In the middle of the relentless wicked news, I hope this is a little bit of encouragement for you, too. Most of us really are doing our best and want to hold each other up.

2262,"I had an important realization this morning. (long post, sorry) I got up pretty early this morning- around 7 AM. I take a medication that must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first half an hour of my morning is usually spent checking social media while waiting for my medication to start working. This morning was no different until I noticed that some birds were chirping outside. This ismon. I live in New York where winter could end in March or it could end in May. We're also the epicenter of the outbreak in the US- I live in Buffalo which has marginally fewer cases than NYC does.   
So, I usually don't pay too much attention to the birds (other than sometimes being annoyed because they're loud and wake me up before I'm ready to be awake). However, today I just kind of stopped and listened to the birds chirping. 

And I just listened for a few moments.

And I suddenly felt this sense of peace.

I realized that the birds have no idea what's going on in the world right now. To them, this is just a normal day. Maybe they know something is different, but it's not bothering them at all right now. They still migrated back to the area because it's getting warmer outside now. 

It gave me a huge sense of hope. Winter sometimes lasts longer than we want it to, and sometimes it ends a lot sooner. It can be really unpredictable. If you've never lived in the Great Lakes, especially in Buffalo, we can get some horrible winter storms that close schools, cause power outages, make it impossible to see when driving, and leave us trapped at home. Sometimes theye in with very little warning. Sometimes they even bring thunder and lightning. Some of the damage from these winters is fixable. Some of it is permanent. 

What is certain is that the birds *always*e back when the winter ends. We may not know when exactly that end wille. Sometimes we think it's over, then ites back with a vengeance. But the birds still return. To me, the sound of birds chirping outside is always a sign that warmer days areing- that better days are toe. 

Now, the birds can't tell me *when* this pandemic will end. No one really knows that. What it reminded me of was the fact that, like winter, the pandemic *will* eventually end. Just like the birds do at the end of winter, we will eventually return to our normal lives, even if things are much different. We are all feeling some sense of anxiety, fear, maybe even anger or frustration. I wanted to share this because just tuning into something I don't usually think about helped me to realize that in a world where so many things are uncertain, what is certain is that the pandemic and being quarantined are both *not permanent.* 

The birds are still out there doing their thing. Even during a disruption of their usual routine, they still return to living their normal lives. Humans are a lot moreplex than birds- I get that- but we, as a species, are capable of rebuilding and returning to normalcy once the worst is over, even if that normalcy is a different from how it used to be. It's going to take time, and that's okay.

2263,"I genuinely don't know when I'll ever be happy again I've never been more fucking depressed in my life. Literally the last day I remember feeling remotely happy was February 25th. Each day is worse. 

There's absolutely nothing to enjoy in life anymore. All I ever do is go to work and then go back home. It's miserable, nothing is fun anymore. I've burned through every damn activity I would possibly want to do at home. So much that I enjoy is either non Essential or considered a mass gathering. Concerts, fairs, etc. I can't even go on vacation at this point. I'm supposed to go to Vegas in November which we rescheduled from June, but I don't that will even happen at this point. 

The worst part is I have no idea when I'll be able to do something I enjoy again. All my concerts got rescheduled till 2021 but I'm not optimistic they'll even happen then. Same with traveling I just don't know when I'll be able to. Going to work only then sitting at home every day isn't a life worth living. I genuinely don't know if I can take another year plus of this bullshit. I truly have nothing to look forward to anymore.

To top it all off when this all started I was just getting into dating. Now I'm pretty sure because of this I'll be alone forever. I'm 22 and have never had a boyfriend and by the time this is all over I'm not sure who's going to want to be with a 23/24 year old who's been single her whole life. I've tried online dating but I don't really see the point if no one wants to meet up. You can only get to know a person so well over text.

Last night she fell ill. Fever, cough, weakness, headache, the works. On Monday, her preteen grandson who resides with her on the weekends, fell ill. He's been tested and has now been on quarantine at his moms house since Tuesday.  Her son - her grandsons father - lives with her full-time and is feeling ill as well as of today. 

My mom and I convinced her to go to the Emergency room this morning and they've decided to keep her overnight and treat her as a Covid patient while we await the test results. 

She is my last living grandparent and I feel like my entire world is going toe crashing down if we get positive test results. 

I'm asking for positive vibes - prayers if that's your thing - and to just please send her all the positive energy her way to hopefully achieve negative results and should they be positive, to somehow pull through this.

2265,"First time out in the new “ normal “ Hey everyone

For the past 3 and a half months, I’ve been doing everything from home. Ordering groceries, laundry, etc. Wiping everything down. Barely going outside. I’ve gone for drives and a few park walks but never around people. 

Now as more and more things open, and it seems like literally everyone I know has been doing there own thing for months, while I’ve stayed in this bubble, I thought it was time for me to get out there again and not feel so scared around people. 

Yesterday was my first real day of going out to a few stores. 

The irony is that everyone who I saw has probably been doing this for three months. Me? I felt like I was in a situation I never been in my life. Avoiding people. Dodging people. Bing overwhelmed. 

Majority of people had masks in the stores, but a few didn’t cover their noses which annoyed and stressed me. That wasn’t even the biggest annoyance though. It was people didn’t give me my space. I was put into situations I wasn’tfortable with because they didn’t social distance. Walking behind me close. When someone walked towards me, I was freaking out looking what way to move. 

Of course ima freak out now and hope I didn’t get sick walking past them but still..

I guess my question is, how do you get over the fear of being around other people now? They are use to it I’m sure, but not me. 

I can’t stay home forever. I will be going back to work soon. So I need to ease my way back

I just think it’s annoying that we don’t know really how it spreads. Will I catch it walking in an area someone else was walking? If they stand somewhere for a few mins and then I walk into that area to walk through, will I get it. 

Just stressful and overwhelming

That’s my vent

Thanks

EDIT UPDATE:

Just went to the grocery store for the first time. It was OK
Except, while waiting to check out 6' ahead of me, was a guy taking his mask on and off and talking. That annoyed me to no end. Then of course, when it was my turn, I had to walk in HIS AIR SPACE and wait 2 mins till it was called. I had a mask on but I really hope I don't catch it because of him

Secondly, the cashier directly behind me coughed. She had a mask on, and coughed into her elbow, so now thats 2 I need to worry about

2275,"Just arrived in the UK from the US and I'm shocked with thepletely different attitude that people have (not wearing masks, no social distancing, etc.) I just moved to London from the US (New England) and... I have to say, I'm shocked. I've obviously seen all of the news, heard all of the talk, everything about *""how bad the US is"", ""how poorly the US is handling the crisis"", ""how people aren't socially distancing or wearing masks"", ""how tons of pool parties and social gatherings are taking place"".* Basically, the US has been dead to the world for some time, especially since the EU imposed somewhat of a ban on US travelers (I even heard of an incident where a woman who was staying in the UK with her husband and kids through all of this, was denied when attempting to board a flight to Spain because she had a US passport).

Even the UK has been depicted as being more responsible than the US... with their limitations for how much people could go outside during the depths of the lockdown, and now with their mandatory two-week quarantine for those arriving from specific places, like the US.

So upon arrival, I thought that things were going to be much stricter than where I was. I was wrong. The immigration officer didn't give much of a damn about my ""quarantine plan"" - you have to state where you're staying and it has to be deemed sufficient, or otherwise, you're taken to designated quarantine facilities... or so they said. 

I've been quarantining in my husband and my flat, nobody has checked up on us, apparently, one in five people will get a phone call during the two week period but that's about it. 

We've only been out for absolutely essential things like a quick grocery trip, to go to the door for deliveries, and for some fresh air - all while wearing masks and staying very far away from others. 

I've been shocked to see that *nobody* is wearing a mask while walking down the street. I understand that it's outdoors and transmission is much less likely in passing, but literally nobody has a mask on or anywhere in sight. Even in New York people are wearing masks while walking down the street. I even saw people alone in their own car with masks on there. Sure there was the odd person without a mask, or wearing it under their chin, but those people got disapproving looks from others.

Even worse, here in London people aren't even wearing masks in *stores.* I popped into a grocery store to grab eggs - decked in out in mask, wielding Clorox wipes, glasses, and a hat - with the intention to just get what I needed fast, and to get out asap - how many of us have been doing in the US. Inside of the store, only about 40% of the customers were wearing masks. The security guard was not, nor were the employees! There were marks for socially distancing on the floor, but nobody was following them, unmasked people were literally bumping my shoulder! The only thing that gave me any solace was that there were walls separating the self-checkouts. 

I would have thought that they would at least require masks in public establishments but they don't!

I was recently warming up to the idea of outdoor dining, but that doesn't even seem to be a norm here either, because indoor dining is now open!

My husband's office is still closed but we have friends who have already gone back to theirs. His is considering opening soon but I'm really skeptical about this and ufortable with the idea. It's getting colder, winter ising, it's about to be major cold and flu season. I feel like all of this is just very premature. 

Yes, the UK did better than New York and the US, but it's because they were stricter, faster. However, once you release those regulations, itpletely has the potential to get bad again, or worse. 

It's frustrating because there's social pressure too. I never felt ufortable wearing a mask in the US because everyone was doing it, now I get weird looks because I'm the only one. Because so much looks ""normal"" here, it's easy to forget that there is a crisis at hand... am I actually being lame if I don't want to go out with friends at this time?

Numbers are on a gradual incline here due to the leniency, no spikes yet, but I'm worried that there could be with schools going back, offices opening up, restaurants, bars, and the cold weather approaching all at once. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong - is the UK actually safer than the US or are we on the verge of a spike? Additionally, I know that the US is a huge place, containing a lot of different cultures and perspectives - New England and the East Coast are arguably in a better way than other parts of it, so what I witnessed might have been the pinnacle of caution while other places may look a little more like where I am now...

2276,"Mother in Law guilt-trip over Easter dinner This is mostly a vent session but thought some might appreciate this grade-A insanity and family drama. We are in a COVID-19 hot-spot in a suburb of NYC in Connecticut. My MIL is a classic anti-vaxxer, thinks this is a 5G conspiracy, being blown out of proportion, attempt to attack Trump, etc, etc. Her already unbalanced beliefs and actions have lead to a generally toxic relationship between her, my husband and me and our two toddlers. We have established strong boundaries and know how to stand up to her but she loves to lay on the guilt trip, set herself up as a victim, and pits my husband’s brother against him as her defender and peacekeeper, which generally sucks. 

today she has texted the group chat we are all in stating that Easter dinner will be at the usual time next Sunday. Like what?? We said we will be happy to FaceTime in and waited for her response. She immediately shot back- “if we are all healthy why is Easter on FaceTime?” We didn’t respond, though I think we probably need to write one calm one-liner about how we aren’t attending any gatherings. 

The most frustrating part is that my husband’s brother has been allowing her to pick up his 6 month old and babysit him at her house. I’m not sure if they are planning to go to her house for Easter or not but if they’re letting her babysit I think they might. There is no legitimate childcare related need to do this as he is not working right now and his wife is working from home so they’re just increasing their risk of infection. My MIL is a cancer survivor so she should not be taking any risks as is. I can’t imagine what is possessing them to do this other than she doesn’t take the virus seriously and he can’t help but try to keep her happy. 

I’m so frustrated that during this stressful time of a global crisis, she somehow finds a way to make this all about her and how enlightened she is and how we are sheep listening to the government. We are need to make sacrifices for themon good. This situation really has the potential to bring out the best and worst in people. I wish I could go off on her but she knows the guidelines and statistics and either thinks they are lies or don’t apply to her. Also, her birthday is in two days so she’s going to guilt us about this too. I’m so grateful my husband and I are on the same team and support each other in dealing with her and keeping her at a distance because this type of toxic relationship is so stressful and can be damaging. 

As much as I know she is unhinged and manipulative, I can’t help but get a little heated, which is why I’m posting here.

2278,"My Grandma, Who I Live With, Just Tested Positive I just need to get this off my chest because it's been causing me anxiety for the last 4 days. While every medical personnel has assured me I won't die even if I do get it, I still need reassurance I'll get through this and be ok.

For context, I am 28 y.o, and I live with my 55 y.o. mom and 80 y.o. grandma in the US.

So, to start from the beginning: My Aunt developed symptoms on Wednesday and tested positive that same day with a rapid test. She had been over the previous Sunday and the day before (Tuesday) to take my grandma out to dinner while my mom went camping because grandma was being a baby about being stuck in the house while mom got away for a few days and had been trying to guilt her into staying home.

After getting news from my aunt Wed., I made my grandma quarantine to her room.  She was tested on Friday and today (Sunday) her test came back positive as well.  

The worst part is that as soon as my mom got the results this morning and came downstairs to tell me (but before she got the chance to tell grandma) apparently grandma decided toe DOWN STAIRS and get her coffee and donut because mom was talking too long.  We started yelling at her to get back upstairs and note back down again because she just tested positive.  She told us we were crazy and she feels fine.  Ugh. My mom did go upstairs and sanitize everything after this with a mask and gloves on though.

Anyway, me and my mom did go get a rapid test today after all that and we both tested negative! I'm still worried about catching it while being stuck in the house with my selfish grandma though. 

We have a 2-story house, she has been quarantined in her room upstairs and can only leave with a mask to use the bathroom; Mom has set up on the main floor and has her own bathroom; and I live in the basement with my own bathroom as well. I suppose our setup is better than most have the luxury of having, but I'm still terrified. I have contamination OCD so I am basically living a nightmare scenario and I have a hard time determining what is safe and isn't because in my mind EVERYTHING in here is contaminated.

I suppose my worst fear is getting it and dying, but all the doctor and nurses who did my test today assured me I wouldn't die even if I did get it.  I'm fairly young and healthy as far as I know, so there's no reason to believe I would likely die from it. Even if that's true, I don't want to catch it and I don't want my mom to either.

EDIT: Before anyone judges my tone on my grandma, please understand that not everyone's grandma is like yours.  Some people's family dynamics aredifferent.  I don't want anything bad to happen to her, she's just not my priority. If you really want a history as to why I feel like this, I can rehash this.  Otherwise just take my word for it before judging me. 

Also take into context I just lost my dad 5 days after he turned 60 in october.  He didn't get to live to 80 and neither has my mom, and I'm not about to lose both parents in a year too.",118,0.97,ifcieg,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ifcieg/my_grandma_who_i_live_with_just_tested_positive/,29,Support,2020-08-24,-12,183,-0.06557377049180328
2280,"Worried about India I live in the United States, where things are getting pretty bad. But I keep thinking about India.

When I was a college student, I had Indian classmates--international students. They were the ones you could always count on to do their part in a group project; they were the ones setting the curve. Once you got past their accents, they were just as nice and personable as anybody else. And they had a passion for learning. I guess it stands to reason that if you are willing to go to a whole different country to go to college, you would have to be somebody who really cares about learning.

Now I can't stop thinking about them--the laughing fellow who could make magic with circuit diagrams, the tiny short girl who's probably a top-notch medical resident by now judging by how well she could explain anything in anatomy. I graduated years ago, so they must be home now.

I keep hearing about how India has a shortage of doctors, India has a shortage of hospitals, India has huge areas where you have to travel for ages to get medical care. About how they're crowded in the cities, and isolated in the countryside, and have so many languages that sometimes it's hard for doctors to evenmunicate with patients. They love technology, they love science, but they're just getting started putting it in place. There are lots of places where you can't even get Internet.

And here I am, in the United States, looking at New York City on the news and seeing Mumbai or New Delhi, and I just... feel so helpless.

I have an immune deficiency and was a ‘miracle baby’ in a way, so I guess these factors may being into play psychologically? Along with the rage of having my 20s stolen from me? I just don’t know.

Since I have aputer now, is there anything I can do to help people without? Would it be weird to contact the school and see if there’s any way I could help? Any kids that they know of who are in a situation where they don’t feelfortable going back to school but also don’t have aputer at home?

So today I went to the pharmacy to pick up some medications. Thankfully, our pharmacy has a curb-side pickup option so that I don’t have to go inside. I’m waiting for the pharmacy tech toe out when a guy in a truck pulls up next to me, and there’s another guy in the passenger seat. Neither are wearing masks. The teches to my window and hands me my medications. Before I can roll the window back up, the guy in the passenger seat in the truck right next to me starts asking the tech questions, without a mask on. We’re maybe 2-3 ft apart at most. I get my window up as quickly as I can, but still. 


Now, I can admit that I’ve been very paranoid about COVID-19. Honestly, I would prefer to not interact with any other human besides my fiancé (whom I live with) for a long time until the pandemic subsides. So going out and interacting with other people right now is a huge trigger for me and my anxiety. 


The guy from the truck looked pretty healthy and I’m trying not to assume, but I honestly couldn’t see why he wouldn’t be wearing a mask while interacting with the public. It freaks me out and now my brain won’t shut up with anxiety about the chances of him possibly spreading the virus to me or the tech. 


I also couldn’t help but note how many people were going in and out of the store and pharmacy without masks on. How are people not scared? How can people just function without applying any caution at this time?

2302,"So are the next 12-18 months just going to be... bad? In the US, Arizona and Texas are seeing some spikes in new cases, and a slight trend upward in hospitalizations. I live in Austin. During the SIP we had (Mid-March thru May 1st), things felt good. It was around this time that NYC and other areas were getting pummeled with the overload in severe cases. Now that NYC is on the downswing, I was feeling a lot more relieved as of late. I started hanging out with a small group of people once a week for the month of May, and COVID19 really wasn't a major concern. Things were starting to feel normal again. I returned to the office.

But now, at least in Travis county, we are seeing an uptick in positive cases. And I'm slightly concerned. Sure, this means that more people are getting tested, but the prevalence of the virus can also be immediately confirmed by this uptick as well. There's no denying that.

Americans in this part of the country have just been so nonchalant about COVID19. I get it, we never saw the severity like NY state did. But I have a bad feeling we're gonna see an actual 1st wave in these places like Houston, Austin, and Arizona that were spared between March-May. Is this how it's gonna be for the next 12-18 months? A few weeks, maybe a month of relief, then a bad surge, and repeat. 

What happens to all of the counties (counties that are of a larger population, I mean) that have done really well when they inevitably open up? Are flights going to be restricted? Is interstate travel going to be restricted? We sure as hell know that won't happen in the US. Ya, do a ""14 day quarantine"", but have no actual method of confirming that people follow these orders.

I've beening into the office everyday now. They require masks to be worn all day and they screen us for temperatures when we walk into the building. At first, this made me feel like I had a strong sense of security and I could go back to the office worry-free. My coworker that I worked closely with stayed home sick for the past 2 days. I was like, sure, I did see her last week, whatever, we were both wearing masks the last time we interacted befores she developed symptoms so I should be fine. The average time span between infection and symptom onset is 5 days, or so I've read.

She came into the office today. I point blank asked her if she was feeling better and she said, no not really. WTF? What are you doing here, I thought to myself?? Again, she was soo nonchalant about it. Did the temperature screening not work or? Or are all these ""measures"" mypany is taking just for optics and not actually keeping me safe?

2303,"My country re-opened, my anxiety is all time high I live in North Macedonia, in Europe near Greece and Serbia if it helps to locate our small country. We have 2 million citizens with 600.000 living in the capital Skopje (where I live).

We closed up pretty early, 11th of March the universities and schools and by the 13th everything except grocery stores and pharmacies was closed. We only had one case in my city at the time.

I sat through terrible anxiety and depression in lockdown since, for almost three months, locked inside my home, not seeing my friends, my brother or my grandmothers. I followed every rule. I never left the house without a mask even for a walk away from people. I have been cleaning floors and products daily (my mom has to go grocery shopping). We had a police enforced curfew since closing, no one allowed to leave their homes after 4pm until the next morning, old people could only from 8 am - 12 pm and young people from 12 pm - 4 pm so they won't mingle. On weekends we couldn't leave at all or face fines/jail time. During Orthodox Easter, our biggest religious holiday, we were locked in for 85 hours and not allowed to leave our houses. We went through all of that.

And suddenly they re-opened everything this week. Cafes, restaurants, malls, city transport, everything. There are still some rules and measures but it's open. No more lockdown. No more quarantine. People are on the streets in masses. And the number of infected is growing rapidly.

We have had 2077 confirmed cases, 121 deaths (which is a lot based on our population) and 470 active cases. About 230 of those are in my city of 600.000 population. My mom works as a nurse and my dad is a doctor, I worry for them. We stacked up supplies yesterday before they re-opened, a month worth of products and for fresh stuff and pharmacy we will go to our local small store since it's easier to avoid others in a store where only a block buys from. I don't know what to do. We have 10% of testse back positive daily.

Now I feel a little better, but I'm still freaked out. I know diarrhea is a symptom of covid in some cases, so every-time I think I'ming down with something, it could possibly be covid, or it could be something else.

2316,"I really hope we get to a point where we don't have to wear face masks Hear me out I am not writing this toplain about them due to the fact they are ufortable.

I am writing about them because honestly they put a huge dent in human interaction. We can't see when someone is talking to us even though we can hear their voice, but we can't see their lips moving. We can't see how someone is feeling, We can't hear them properly some of the time and as long as we keep seeing masks the more it just makes things feel uneasy.

This might be overreacting or silly, but one of the huge reasons I hate the mask thing is it constantly reminds you of the pandemic itself. Don't get me wrong I know it's good to wear one and I will continue to for as long as the states mandate it. I just hope that when this does die down we can go back to not wearing face masks.

I love seeing the joy on people's faces when they are happy. I can tell when someone is upset and they are holding it back. I can see how a person is feeling based on how their face is reacting to whatever emotion they are feeling. I can't see any of that behind a face mask and that to me is a depressing social interaction. I thought I would be relived talking to someone that was outside waiting for food with me while we were six feet apart. When I tried to make them laugh or smile and I couldn't tell if I did or not it really was depressing.

2321,"For those like me who sometimes feel this isolation has put a halt to the newfound transformation you had going pre-quarantine. Think of it not as an interruption, but as another (BIG) stepping stone in your journey of mental health I've been going between waves of depression and calm. If you're like me and you just recently, before isolation, began to find mental strength and inner peace, or you were struggling with that battle, you know how much work it takes to get there. You probably feel the irony of this situation as hopelessness, as though it was all for nothing and that you will never be allowed the happiness you've had to fight for, maybe even make sacrifices for. I'm sure you've fallen back into those feelings of anxiety, self-worthlessness or whatever it may be, as those tools you were using to find that happiness (social activity and many hobbies) are put on pause. You feel that, just as you began to feel ""normal"" or ""like everyone else,"" that same ""normal"" has been flipped upside down on you.

Only 3 months ago, I (26 F) ended a 5-year relationship and left all my friends and everything else I know to move across the country and do some serious soul-searching. Nothing was really wrong in my relationship, friendships or life in general, but I had also never been single since age 16 and knew deep down that my depression/anxiety/anger wereing from a serious codependency issue, an inability to cope with anything on my own. I am also an outdoor adventurist as well as songwriter/musician, so I knew my serious relationship was stifling my dreams and only making me resentful of those I loved. I'm genuinely a very calm, kind and caring person, and also a very independent individual, but I couldn't figure out how to be that person fully, other than to leave everything behind and go some place where I didn't know anyone. As gut-wrenchingly difficult as it was to make those sacrifices, I put myself in that difficult situation, knowing that I would have to force myself out of an even deeper depression than before, but I would be doing it all on my own, and I woulde out stronger as that person I knew I could be. Sure enough, just a couple of months into my new life, I was transforming from the most depressed, unsure state I've ever experienced into a blossoming, happy, peaceful, passionate social butterfly. I had the perfect balance of introspective alone time and social activity. All my mental issues were truly bing healed, I was thriving in my hobbies, and even meeting really cool people when I'd go out to concerts every weekend. My ""plan"" was going so well and I truly felt ""born-again"" as they say. 

Fast forward a week or two, and now I am not allowed to go out and meet people or try to get to know any of those people I did already meet. I can still go hiking, but not allowed to enjoy it with other people (which is fine, I do enjoy solo outdoors, but still.. I now live in a beautiful state where the weather is about to get nice and pretty for some group activity) writing music can be nice, but I'm so distracted that its hard to fully focus and be pumped about it for extended periods of time. I've been reaching out to my ex A LOT because I have no close friends here yet, and with the stress and loneliness of all of this, it almost feels necessary. 

Needless to say, my weaknesses of anxiety and depression have had their place in my head the past couple weeks. However, I have begun to find a sense of calm in knowing that if I can get through this alone, it's mentally like everything else I've been through the last few months...I'lle out stronger on the other side. It's just another challenge... a really weird, crazy, huge challenge.

I say all of this, not to just say that you are not alone. But if the uneasiness of this virus and quarantine has made you feel like you've just been robbed of your self-love, mental strength, spiritual awareness, social acceptance or whatever beautiful path you were on, its just a reminder that you still have work to do on your mental/emotional/spiritual health. It is always a work in progress after all. You and I WILL make it through ande out STRONGER on the other side because we've already made it this far in life. Getting through this mental challenge will show us that we can handle a level of stress so great that requires us to let go of control and stop expecting life to go as planned. We will find that we are much more flexible than we ever thought we could be.

2325,"Common misconceptions about how deadly this virus is and why you are most likely overestimating your odds of succumbing to this Now first of all, I'm not a native English speaker so please excuse my sometimes questionable grammar.

**Also, I do not intend to downplay the situation.** This Pandemic is bad, it's crushing economies, it overwhelms hospitals and it currently causes thousands of unfortunate casualties each day.

**BUT:**

The odds of you dying, no matter how old you are or how dire your pre-conditions, are much lower than you are currently afraid of. Bold statement, I know, let me explain: What people and scientists are referring to when talking about how many people succumb is the **C**ase **F**atality **R**ate (CFR). What does it mean? It measures the % of people out of the **tested and confirmed** infected who succumb. But this isn't an accurate reflection of how many infected actually die. Scientists have to use CFR as a reference because it's the only number that is for certain.

So, what gives us an actual representation of how many infected people actually die? It's called the **I**nfection **F**atality **R**ate (IFR). This includes not only the tested and confirmed, but also the symptomatic people who are not tested because they're not bad enough to have the very limited testing capacity used for them, but most importantly it includes the large amount of people without any symptoms at all, or just super slight ones like a loose stool, back pain, slightest sore throat etc, basically people who would never think that they're infected and therefor wouldn't get tested, unless they have a confirmed relative. But sincemunity spread is now, sadly, the main driver of infections, you can't really ever be safe from not bing infected as long as youe in contact with anyone, so there will be even less asymptomatic / low symptomatic cases being found. Of course the IFR will, by the nature of it, always be just an estimation. But with the limited testing capacity around the globe, we just won't know any better. But there are good ways to estimate the IFR rather precisely regardless.

So, we know that CFR is estimated to be at around 3.4% by the W.H.O, we know that it is much higher than that in Italy and Spain. But what about IFR?

I have an excellent report here by the highly reputable [Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine]( which covers exactly this: [ (scroll further down to the 26. March updates)

Important Quote:

>Our current best assumption, as of the 22nd March, is the IFR is approximate 0.20% (95% CI, 0.17 to 0.25)

I don't want to make this post much longer than it has to be, so please visit the link and read for yourself how theye to this conclusion.

Further evidence for a much lower IFR:

Germany, my hood! We have as of writing this (according to [Worldometer]( relatively close to as many confirmed cases as Spain, but they have 20x (!) as many casualties. I know: Beer, Sauerkraut and Leberkäse makes us strong. In all seriousness though, the Virus doesn't care about your birthplace, it's impossible that Spain would have that many more casualties if their infection count would be accurate if youpare them to Germany. What you can conclude here is that Spain (as well as any other country with a oddly high CFR, like Italy) just hasn't identified nearly as many of their infected people as Germany has. And yes, even Germany will have a not so insignificant amount of people still undiagnosed, simply because so many people are asymptomatic or have only super slight, barely noticeable symptoms.

So yeah, the Pandemic is a catastrophe and we must do EVERYTHING we can to slow it down, but it is not going to kill you as likely as you might have had the impression of.

**TLDR:** CFR does not reflect the actual % of infected who succumb. IFR, so all infected not just the confirmed ones, is estimated only to a fraction of the CFR.

March update)]( for reference.",103,0.97,fpew1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/fpew1l/common_misconceptions_about_how_deadly_this_virus/,38,NA,2020-03-27,-33,229,-0.14410480349344978

This morning I get a call from my mom, who tells me that one of her staff tested positive for Covid, and she sent home another bartender who was in close contact as well. She wanted me toe in tonight to lend a hand since she’s nervous she’s going to be short staffed.

I’m 25. I have a full time job and work from home. I’ve gone to maybe two restaurants when my home state was among the lowest case per capita in the nation. Other than that, it’s been social distance hangs and Take-out only. I wear masks everywhere I go, even just walking down the street.

She desperately wanted me toe home from Texas when it was spiking, fearing my safety. So, I ended my lease and went back to my home state to live with her.

- Are you closing down at LEAST the area she was working in?

2345,"Is This Really The New Normal? The title kind of says it all.

At the beginning of this people were talking about social distancing etc. as a temporary disruption that was necessary to contain the spread of the virus and keep the hospitals from being overwhelmed. Which to me makes sense and I think that's absolutely right.

But lately I hear people talk about this as the ""new normal"".  Like, this isn't some temporary thing but is apletely new way of life. In the same way 9/11 changed flying by requiring extensive airport security, this pandemic is going to require masks/social distancing/restrictions/everything over Zoom from now on, and like these changes will be with us for good.

And sadly that makes some sense to me. The virus is never going to 100% go away. Even if we get a vaccine it won't be 100% effective and not everyone will take it. So there will still be spread, even if not quite as much, but still reason to keep social distancing in place. 

I just can't imagine this. I don't know what's the point of continuing on with my life. Why should I put in any kind of effort to move forward with my life if my future is going to take place in a dystopian, distanced, virus fearing world? 

I don't want to keep six feet apart forever. I don't want to wear a mask forever. I don't want to do everything over Zoom forever. And I feel as if I don't have a choice, that's what my future holds. And I just can't accept that. I don't know how.

I just want to scream every time I hear the phrase ""new normal"". I can't do it. I don't want this to be the rest of my life. I'm young, in my early 20s. I feel like I had the rest of my life ahead of me. And now I feel like I've lost it all. Maybe I still have the rest of my life, but instead of being in the world I grew up in, it's going to be in a world that's a shadow of it's old self, with a quality of life a fraction of what it was. And I've been hearing all about this ""new normal"" being long term/permanent lately.

I'm sorry if I sound selfish. I don't mean it that way. I know people are dying. I know this virus is serious and that social distancing and these rules are being done with good intentions. But it doesn't make my life any more bearable or my future any more hopeful.",95,0.98,hnvzai,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hnvzai/is_this_really_the_new_normal/,50,Trigger Warning,2020-07-09,-5,105,-0.047619047619047616

2347,"My uncle has it. Hey... I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. I hope it is.

Basically, my uncle (60s, diabetic) contracted coronavirus, has had it for probably weeks but the test finally came back positive on Friday. He's been in the hospital ever since. The treatments they're trying aren't working that well, and today they called my aunt (also 60s, probably has corona too, all alone in her house) to tell her to prepare herself, and that they're trying a last resort, prone ventilation.

My cousin (same uncle's daughter) is a nurse and has connections, so she had a doctor call the hospital to ask about him. As of right now (Wednesday 4/1 12 am EST) the prone ventilation made his ""numbers improve a little"". He is apparently ""stable"" right now, but still in ""critical condition"".

My entire family are going out of their minds with worry, me included. I feel sick, this is my closest uncle, he's like a second father to me. He has three young grandchildren that need him. I don't want him to give up, and I don't want to give up ON him, either. I'm not religious, so I'm not praying, but I want to hope for the best.

I'm just a mess right now and need someone to give me even the slightest ounce of hope. I'm so scared.

**UPDATE 4/1 4:30PM EST**: Currently, the prone ventilation is working well for him. He doesn't do as well without the prone position, but this doctor seems a bit more hopeful than the one yesterday, and he is not doing worse. They do have another method to try if this doesn't work. Thanks for the kind words, thoughts, and prayers everyone! I'll keep you all updated! <3

**UPDATE 4/3 2:00AM EST**: He's doing a liiiittle bit better! My poor aunt, bearing this all alone quarantined in her house... I hope she doesn't get worse, either, but one thing to worry about at a time I guess. My uncle's vitals are getting slightly better, and they're putting him in the prone position for slightly smaller amounts of time.

2348,"My anxiety has never been this bad, and no one is taking me seriously The virus has affected pretty much every aspect of my life. I dream about epidemics, I cant eat (and trust me, I LOVE food), I'm constantly crying, and I've started shaking constantly, which has never happened before so, yknow, *that's* fun.

I can tell other people all day long that we'll be fine, that things will turn out okay and for now all we can do is be aggressively clean and take immune support, and eat right. But I have a mental block and I'm almostpletely unable to convince myself I'm gonna be okay. Last night I woke up twice just to have a panic attack and then go back to sleep.

Like, my grandparents are both in their mid 60s, with my grandma having diabetes. I've been going crazy over the fact that they could die, and I'd be homeless and alone, but honestly, despite them being older they both are fairly healthy. I'm more worried for my grandma since her immune system is weaker and she tends to take more time to heal, but even with that I'm really trying to stay positive. I wish they'd listen to me about prepping and staying at home but of course they wont.

Im worried about me, too. Like, yeah, I'm 20. My immune system holds up two middle fingers to illnesses and I know how to keep myself safe from germs. But I cant get over the fact that there are people who are asymptomatic. What if I'm a carrier and I dont know it? Or if I'm healthy, what if I get the virus? I'm taking information in with a grain of salt, but I've read they're saying it attaches itself to your brain stem, and causes permanent damage to organs. I'm only 20. I havent gotten to live yet, and theres a chance I'll be sickly forever. On top of that, I have irrational embarrassment over being sick. With something like COVID, i feel like my pride and my sense of self would be so insanely damaged were I to catch it, that I may never mentally recover.

And I just started at this amazing job recently, the best job I've ever had. But with the way things are going I'm worried I'm gonna have to quit, both to prevent myself from bing ill and because my anxiety/depression is making me shut down. Yesterday was a really bad day, especially. Went to the bathroom and cried, zoned out all day, etc etc.

I've been feeling so hopeless and anxious over this scenario, and so powerless. I just want to drop off the face of the earth. I feel trapped and I could use someone to help me rationalize this.

It’s exhausting and I don’t want to do it anymore but I feel like I have an obligation to themunity since some dumb shit heads continue to not take this disease SERIOUSLY!!!! 

The government and the media now basically expect us to be the face of coronavirus. Every time they want to do a story on the pandemic they just txt me asking when we’re free for an interview. I had to draw the line when the state asked if they could COME INTO MY HOUSE and film my husband tethered to his O2 machine and play the footage during ads on TV to encourage people to stay home. The girl was kind of rude when she asked me too. like she didn’t really ask she just expected that I would be ok with this??? and she was like... surprised when I said no??? So irritating. I don’t really like attention and now everywhere we go peoplee up to my husband like “oh I saw you on the news are you getting better?? howe HE didn’t get sick?” about me. 

Sorry to vent I know this post probably doesn’t make much sense and is probably filled with grammatical errors I just really really need to get this off my chest and there’s no one I can talk to about all this because I’m supposed to shut up and just be grateful that my husband is alive

2353,"Sick of the moral weight of this. I'm so sick of feeling like every single action I take has this enormous moral weight to it that it didn't used to have. Want to hang out with a friend? Cool, if I have it and I'm asymptomatic I could potentially kill her at-risk family. Want to go to a store? It better only be for groceries or else I'm being selfish and putting people at risk. Want to vent about how my mental health is suffering for this? Prepare for a barrage of people reminding me people are dying, and treating mental health like some Health Lite that isn't as important as physical wellness.

It infuriates me seeing people almost gleeful at the thought that someone they don't like catching it. Illnesses are not punishments only for ""bad"" people. When people react to pictures of young people partying and say, ""Just give it two weeks..."" It's cruel, there's no other way around it. The moral judgment around who ""deserves"" to get it is awful, and ites from people who claim they want cases to go down. Yes, I want people to stop having large parties too, and I'm as pro-mask as theye, but they STILL don't ""deserve"" to catch this and spread it.

God. We just can't reasonably expect people to stay this terrified for THIS LONG and expect them to be able to keep it up. I'm at my limit with it myself. I'd rather weigh the risk over reward and act accordingly than go another six months like this.

My OCD revolves around a constant sense of guilt, so this unending moralization over an illness which doesn't follow human morality is making me suicidal. I'll feel okay when I'm distracting myself, but the moment something reminds me of what's going on the ideation starts all over again.

I just want to have a normal day again, without worrying that some small action of mine will have a butterfly effect and hurt people.

2354,"My sister is still having a physical wedding Hi, hello, so here are a few things about my current situation. I’m an “essential worker” otherwise known as a grocery store employee. When this whole thing started to gain momentum I moved out of my parents home since they are older and moved in with my partner. Everything was good and going smoothly and then my mother fell down the stairs. I moved back in to take care of her until she got back on her feet (literally, she broke her foot). I have done so many things to keep myself distanced from people and I wear masks. I also correct people to wear theirs properly it’s part of my job and it’s a hard habit to break when off the clock. Both of my parents are higher risk of infection due to age and disabilities. So I take more precautions because of this.

Now heree the part I need advice on. My sister got engaged last year and had her wedding planned for late October 2020. My family is spread out along the west coast and her wedding is to be held in southern California. She initially postponed her wedding for 2 years because that’s as far out as her venue would let her push it. Now she has been told by the venue since she’s put a deposit down that she has to have the wedding or risk not getting her money back. This is because the venue will most likely go under.

Surprisingly my sister has announced her wedding is going as originally planned but with only 20 people. Most of the guests live in the area, namely the grooms side. But my parents and I live in Oregon, and two other guests live in Washington. I cannot get a lot of time off so driving down isn’t an option. Flying scares the hell out of me right now, so does going to California in this current world. And not to mention going to a multi state function where I don’t know how safe everyone has been.

So I called my sister today and explained all of this to her. I told her unfortunately I will not be going to her wedding. Which I think is the right thing to do. If I were in her shoes I would just give up on the 8k that I spent on the wedding and wait until everything settled. But she can’t see that option.

Instead of listening to me and hearing out why I won’te to her wedding she flipped the script on me. She brought up all sorts of facts about how safe air travel is and how safe the venue is. She told me how the cases were down in her area. To make her point really sting she told me that I was being overly anxious about it all because I have an anxiety disorder and I deal with the public so I’m inclined to see the worst.

Am I overreacting? I don’t think I am but everyone around me is making me feel like some kind of over anxious paranoid freak.",91,0.98,igt7ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/igt7ei/my_sister_is_still_having_a_physical_wedding/,78,Support,2020-08-26,-9,146,-0.06164383561643835

2356,"If someone says “new normal” one more time I am going to explode First off, please note that I always follow every precaution such as wearing a mask in public. I stay home with my baby all day; we go on walks and play together as much as possible. My anxiety is severe: this is NOT normal and I don’t want this to be a new normal. A world of covered faces is not normal. My baby cried the first time he saw me in a mask. A world of social distancing is depressing and not normal. Not being able to experience a parade or fireworks or a theme park or a sports game is not normal. This isn’t what I dreamed of for my child and I cry every day. I just want to fucking go to the mall, browse, and sip a coffee without a hot mask on my face all day. I want life back. I am not living.

2357,"My job's ""precautions"" are a total joke I just started back at my factory job after returning home from college. Thepany I work for is making everyone wear masks, do temperature checks upon arriving, cleaning and sanitizing bathrooms and break rooms often, etc. 

Thepany provided people with masks who don't have one to use; others bring masks from home. Most people wear thepany-provided mask, which is a thin, single-layer, loose-fitting mask (basically no protection whatsoever). Many wear them improperly. 

The thermometers aren't accurate at all. I walk 5 blocks to work from my house, and the forehead theromometers (I used three because I didn't think they were accurate) read 94 degrees. If someone dide in with a fever, the thermometers wouldn't detect it. Hopefully they'd feel physically sick enough to not bothering in, or to at least go to the nurse. 

Social distancing is aplete fail. I'm on an assembly line and pretty much nobody even tries to give each other space. I can reach out and touch one or two people (or more) most places I stand. 

Even though break rooms and bathrooms get cleaned and sanitized, the main floors where we work do not. Dirty surfaces, tools, etc. 

Our facility is ventilated-- we have two large vents that circulate air from outside, plus there's smaller fans everywhere. So basically any potential virus is blown everywhere! 

Of the 1400+ workers at my factory, 4 or 5 have gotten Covid since the beginning of the year. So far, nobody in my department has gotten sick. But if someone does, a lot of others probably will too. 

Both my parents, whom I still live with, have health issues, and are in their 50s. My dad and my brother also work in the same factory, but in different departments where social distancing is much easier than in my department. I'd be most likely to get infected and bring home the virus to my family. Oh, and my house makes it impossible to self-isolate, so if I get sick, we all get sick. 

I've had a lot of anxiety surrounding Covid before starting work, and now that I've started, I'm feeling hopeless. I need the money, and few places in town pay as well. I currently don't have a car and can't drive myself to a different job so that others in my family can drive to their jobs, so having the factory walking distance from my house is convenient (though I still plan to save up for one). I feel like I'm in a really bad situation and I can't really do much of anything to improve it. 

I really want to avoid this awful virus, mostly for my parents' sakes. I'm more likely to be mostly okay if I get it (though I'm still scared of it) than they are.

2364,"Husband is on a ventilator, day 5 today, I think. Sometimes, it gets so dark. He has grown children and we have a teenage son together. The boy and I are holed up in the house, waiting for our test results, trying to stay apart as much as possible. 

I can only make one call per day to check up on him; when I do, I get choked up and can barely ask questions. I don't really want to know the numbers or the statistics, I just want to hear that he hasn't gotten worse and is still alive. I don't want to bother the staff who is keeping him alive. 

One of the adult children has taken this over for me, and she makes a second call in the evening to get more details, which is helpful to the kids. I get that they want to know more details, but for me, it changes \*nothing\*. I can do \*nothing\* about his condition. We don't even pray, being born-again non-believers. The best I am able to do right now is not falling apart, take care of the kid and myself, and get through each day, minute by minute. 

This is a nightmare I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, but a lot of good has happened as well; my credit union deposited a gift of $300 in my account when I reached out about suspending mortgage payments, my friends threw a parade for my other friend who, in a terrible coincidence, happens to have a husband in the same ICU as mine in the same condition. She's all alone, though, and I wanted to show her that she had lots of people rooting for her, so we had a parade of about 30 cars drive by her house with a sheriff escort a few days ago and it was awesome!

2369,"Is anyone else scared to go back to work? I was laid off and put on furlough when my work closed in March. I feel safer at home. In 2018 I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, so this hasn’t helped matters. Whenever you are out in public, other people don’t respect personal distance and walk right up to you without even asking. My father (he’s high risk from his health issues) and I have been social distancing from others and staying home where we feel safe. The only time he goes out is to do curb side at the grocery or our favorite pizza place. The last I heard from work they weren’t going to be open to the public and just do curb side services. Then, out of the blue, last week they announced that we are open. I get another email and it says due to the concern of legal action that they aren’t going to require the public to wear masks. The higher up staff will be safely behind plexiglass barriers, but not people in my position. I don’t feel safe to go back to work. My counselor said it is normal and okay for me to be too scared to go back to work in a public place during a pandemic. She is looking into extending my unemployment. She said they have unemployment set aside for this reason. She told me she was going to get my documentation of my mental health disability (generalized anxiety disorder) ready in case the state asks for me. This was on Wednesday and I haven’t heard back.

2375,"I feel like the world be more of a dark and cold place ever since the pandemicmenced I’m 21F and I posted on here a little while back it I wanted toe back and vent.

I by no means am I an anti-masker nor am I anti-social distancing by any means. HOWEVER it concerns me a lot that so many people are trying to normalize masks and social distancing post pandemic, if we even get there. I loved going to concerts and events pre pandemic but it hurts me knowing that I may never get to experience concerts, festivals, or really any other events. My heart breaks every time I see videos from concerts in the past because I might never get to experience that sense of euphoria again because of covid restrictions and people who believe we should social distance forever. Physical touch also happens to be one of my main love languages and it also hurts a lot that I won’t be able to hug my friends when I return to college, heck it hurts more that I might not be able to see them since this is my last semester of college.

As for masking again I’m not anti-mask but mask wearing makes the world seem colder. I wear one when I go out and I understand why we wear them but I deal with dyspraxia and wearing a mask makes me feel disoriented when I talk, causing me to stammer more than usual. I also am very claustrophobic and sensitive around the nose and mouth area which doesn’t help either. I tend to rely on the whole face whilemunicating, not just the eyes. Not to mention that not being able to see people smiling or even their facial expressions takes away part of the experience of being human. We’re not meant to live covered up and I’m scared that this is gonna last forever rather than temporary.

It sucks that people had the nerve to polticize the virus, especially since those people were sympathetic to those in Italy and Spain when they were struggling yet believe it’s a hoax when ites to the US. Meanwhile the government is adding gasoline to this fire that Covid created. On top of that with the virus, lockdowns, protests, social media, crazies on both political sides, and social upheavals people aren’t aspassionate and sympathetic towards others and would rather argue and fight instead of helping out and supporting. 

I just want to go back to life pre-covid even though I’ve been going through a rough patch for a little while.

Soon enough this whole COVID-19 thing started. First it was in china, then it was in Italy, then it was in the internet, in the news, in America, then no ramen soups or TP, lockdowns, and now my poor little nephew is sick with the creeping crud!

2380,"Sudden intense anxiety due to impending changes happening within the next few days, I can't sleep through the night, I can't eat, and I can't cope, how do I get through this? I'll try to keep this as organized as possible but there are so many factors at play and I feel like they're necessaryponents to explain, so thank you in advance if you do manage to read this.

I'm 24, and covid 19/lockdowns has been a considerable disruption in my life and mental health in a lot of ways.

Where to begin...

I was in the midst of getting my UK visa to join my husband when everything started closing down. I had returned to the US in January to go through the application process which should have only taken two months maximum. I was literally supposed to have my visa and be returning to my husband the week that everything closed. This has been really difficult because we only just got married in September and I haven't seen him since January.

I've been staying in my parents' home during this time, which I am incredibly grateful for but it has also been really hard for me. I haven't spent more than two weeks in their house since I was 18 years old. When I moved away for college, I never came back, I spent every summer and winter away, and when I met my now-husband I was frequently abroad. We moved in together in the UK last June.

My childhood home surfaces a lot of buried feelings and memories. There was always a sense of nostalgia when I would visit my parents but I never spent enough time to actually recall any ""trauma"". I say ""trauma"" lightly because I was never blatantly abused, but I had a difficult childhood - I'm an only child, I always dealt with loneliness, my mother has PTSD and we always had a troubled relationship, and so on.

So even just spending two months here as was initially expected was going to be difficult... let alone, seven.

Quarantine has been especially long and trying. When visa processing was paused in March, I panicked, I felt trapped because there was no way that I could get back to my husband because you can't travel with a pending visa, and we held out on having my husbande to me because we thought that, surely, concessions would be made for those in my position - spoiler alert, they weren't.

I was already in a bit of a depression, dealing with memories from my childhood, mourning my independence, not feeling like myself, feeling like I was regressing, missing my husband, etc. Then I fell into absolute despair for several weeks, pulled myself out of it, found ways to be productive, got back into healthy habits, and generally found a way to cope for a while. After a month and a half of quarantine I started to feel really frustrated and honestly, abandoned by my husband because of his resistance toing to be with me in the US - his reason was that it would be too hard to balance work and the time difference - which is difficult but I didn't think would be *too* difficult. I started to feel like my feelings didn't matter, and that supporting me through a difficult time was not more important than his having the idealfortable working situation. This sent me into more depression, frustration, which I again had to pull myself out of on my own - this was around May. I kind of sustained myself and my mood for a while until about two weeks ago.

With quarantine orders lifting in a lot of areas, I started to see a lot of my friends going out again, some more responsibly than others, but I haven't been able to do the same as my parents are both vulnerable and my father is extremely anxious about the disease and doesn't feelfortable with my meeting up with any friends even if we're outdoors and safe. I haven't spent any in-person time with anyone my age in nearly five months. So about two weeks ago I kind of threw the structure that I had created for myself to the wind and fell apart, started spending entire weekends in bed again, and generally feeling like I was just losing it - but this was depression... clearly circumstantial because I am an otherwise very productive and positive person when things are normal.

But I knew it wouldn't last forever, because my husband is finallying to the US, I'm going to get to see him next week after seven months apart. My visa might finally go through, this month and we could be back in the UK together by September.

This should all be great... I should be happy, but the crippling anxiety hit about two days ago. I dealt with anxiety as a child but it was due to my troubled relationship with my mom. Ipletely shed that issue when I became independent and moved out. I haven't really experienced it that much during my time here until now.

Starting two days ago I haven't been able to sleep through the night. I keep having all of these ""what if"" anxious thoughts creeping in. Like my brain is rapidly analyzing every possible worst-case scenario imaginable. I'm worried about his transit, I'm worried about my transit, I'm worried about literally everything, rational and irrational, likely and unlikely. The only thing that I'm not that worried about is either one of us contracting the illness, I think we'd be ok, my fears are more-so surrounding anything that could possibly get in the way of us reuniting, from mild to extreme.

It's to the point where I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the next few days. I'm trying to look forward to his arrival, I'm trying to list the things that I need to do before hees to keep myself busy, but sometimes I just find myself unable to do anything at all and just frozen with fear. To make matters worse, both my psychiatrist (not for SSRI's or anything - I have mild ADHD) and therapist are out of office this week so I have no one to talk to and nobody to prescribe me anything for this short-term meltdown. Even though I have fewer nights than I can count on one hand to spend alone after this long and incredibly difficult time - I dread each and every one of them because I know that each one will involve hours trying to fall asleep, only to wake up around 1am and remain awake and anxious for the next few hours, maybe several times over.

I've really tried to be introspective in order to understand why I'm feeling this way, rationalize it, and find a way to cope and calm my thoughts. I think that it's because I feel like everything is so precarious right now. I desperately want to see my husband and get back to our life together, I'm so afraid of anything happening that could take it all away. I'm dealing withing out of a very long, winding emotional rollercoaster, this has not been an easy time and I need to give myself credit because I've coped arguably well for the majority of it. And I think that even though I'm incredibly eager for this next chapter and to feel like I'm moving forward again, there's also difort in getting out of this seven-month rut that I've been in, even though I absolutely don't want to continue it and it hasn't beenfortable, I just haven't experienced any change in that amount of time so the prospect of change is triggering all sorts of anxiety for me rather than excitement... and my perception of it all being precarious makes matters so much worse.

Wow, that was incredibly long, so thank you if you've made it this far.

I know that this is a particularly unique situation so it's really hard to offer advice, but I think ultimately, I'm wondering what I can do to stop these doomsday / ""what if"" thoughts and just manage to get through the next few days with my sanity intact? It's like, to the point, where I want my husband to change his plane ticket because ofpletely irrational and superstitious fears. I've never dealt with anything like this before and I know that it'spletely circumstantial - and a culmination of everything that I've been feeling over this period of time, but knowing that it will pass is not enough to get me through the now.

I hope this made at least some sense...

2386,"An update on my COVID story My wife and I had COVID in April and I joined this group while she was in the hospital for it. I was fighting it home alone and the support I received here made a world of difference. She was there a week, on oxygen but not a respirator. It's now four months from the worst of it and I was asked how we're doing now. Below is my response. A reply to it asked that I make this a new thread since it's informative and shows a fairly typical experience. I hope this answers some questions and I will answer any new ones when possible. An update in the past two days, the COVID smell is stilling and going. The question was, ""How are you doing now?"" my answer:
We're mostly good. I actually have had reoccurring symptoms and am lumped in with the ""long haulers"". After recovery, I was fine for a few weeks then started having chest pains, foggy head, tiredness, and the smell of cigarette smoke in my nose (I call it the COVID smell). Went to urgent care and an ekg and X-ray came up clear. After a week or so, the pains stopped, two weeks the tiredness, but the COVID smell lasted five weeks. I was then fine for about a week before the smell came back, foggy head, and this time heart palpitations. Went to the ER because urgent care was closed. Ekg and X-ray came up fine again. They gave me an anti anxiety med for a few days. That was about three weeks ago. The palpitations have subsided mostly (it still happens briefly occasionally), the fog has lifted, and the smell went away about four days ago. (Update, it's stilling and going) I joined the Survivor Corps Facebook group and try to chime in with my experiences and help when I can. I am really hoping this is the last I have symptoms. A lot of the people in the FB group believe that it's neurological or nerve damage that is causing the odd symptoms to resurface since many also have clean tests for the chest pains and heart palpitations. The wife is much better off than I. She had some slight hair loss post COVID and a reoccurring cough, but the cough could also be environmental or from a med she takes because it was there prior to COVID, just not as often. Thank you for asking and I really hope my story can help people realize the importance of adhering to protective policies and that people do survive this thing.

2387,"I may have lost the love of my life because of the pandemic (I posted about this briefly earlier and wanted to elaborate more)

In early March, I had one of the best dates of my life with someone I met on Match. Insane chemistry, a night of dancing, an inside joke after only a few hours together...and then SHTF a week later. At first, we were able to be flexible, treating it like a long distance relationship and watching ""end-of-world"" movies like Zombieland over FaceTime to keep our spirits up.  But losing my job and her job transitioning to at-home put enormous stress on both of us.  After a month and a half of social distance dating, she broke it off with me suddenly and without explanation with a text that sounded copy-pasted.

I'm looking back on that date now and wondering if it's the last time I will ever experience true joy.  We never went more than 20 seconds without talking that night and you could cut the attraction and sexual tension with a knife.  And her voice...my God, her voice was like an angel's.

They closed down one of the high schools where a student was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 from a GP practicing 25 minutes away. No one knows how the GP contracted it, they can't track down the patient\[s\] who might have given the virus to them, apparently. 

The student was confirmed to have been in school for several days before being taken in for medical treatment. The GP is in an isolation ward less than 30 minutes away.

But I know it won't, now. It's closer to home than it was 24 hours ago. Who knows how many people are already infected from those two. I knew it was probably only a matter of time, but now that it's here, I feel like I'm entering a slow descent into darkness.

2396,"I want to give up... I don't know what to do.

I'm getting ready to sell my mother's house, the one that she was so proud of. It was the one that she worked so hard for.

Growing up we never stayed in one place very long. Generally we'd make it about 3 months before the rent became late and we had to be evicted. But Mom would always do what she could to make sure that her kids were fed.

Now that she's gone I'm faced with the horrible practicality of tying up her loose ends. I'm selling the house that she hoped to one day give my daughter. After all the vultures have had their fill will be left with about $7,000 with which we can pay her outstanding debts. One wonderful woman's life amounts to a net value of nothing.

On Tuesday I went to the house to make sure that all of the appliances were still working. We're closing on Wednesday of next week. I was sitting in that living room looking looking at that empty house and I could still smell my mom in the air. It was overwhelming.

I sat in the driveway and was met with a overwhelmingpulsion to drive into the garage and close the door. It was so strong that it scared the hell out of me.

Today I reached out to my wife and mental health professionals. They want me to check into a hospital, but there are no beds available. Maybe tomorrow will be different. I just can't see myself checking into an emergency department and spending the night on a mattress on the floor. Because that's what happens when there's no room. I can't even think of being in a hospital, in an emergency department, when covid is walking through the door every few minutes.

I know I'm safe for the time being. My wife is been amazing through this. She's so understanding. I know that I would never do this to my children. But thepulsion was so frighteningly strong that I don't know what I would do if I felt any worse than I do right now.

My anonymous friends, Don't suffer in silence. Reach out to someone for support. Don't just assume that things will get better. Cuz I'm not sure that they ever will. I'm in a safe place right now and I'm going to do what it takes to get better. I just don't know when it will be.

2397,"If You Are Having Anxiety Over COVID-19, Consider Not Reading The News/News Subreddits for Awhile (An Option) Many of us, myself included are here because we are terrified of the current Coronavirus situation. I will not downplay it, it is a scary situation to be sure,  and there is no certainty when things will go back to a semblance of normal.

That said, from personal experience if you are struggling it may be time to step away from the news cycle.

It will be hard, especially if you are hanging on every word right now. You want to be informed, know whats going on, be prepared for the future! Hell maybe a new piece of information about death rates/illness length/ect will appear. The issue is that at this point, you **ALREADY KNOW** almost everything you need to know about whats going on, but you are still exposing yourself to your stressor.

We all know the media runs on clicks, and boy are they mining them hard now. Think about this. How likely are you to click a link with a scary title? Scrolling through a feed, which are you more likely to click, ""A Timetable to Recovery from COVID-19"" or ""How Will the World Recover From the Untold Damage from Coronavirus"" (I suck at making up headlines, but hopefully you get the point)? Hell there has been an article running amok today about Lung Scarring with a sensationalist headline like ""Why You Will Never Be the Same if You Get Coronavirus"". If you see that in passing it will scare the SHIT out of you, but only if you really read it, and it's source will you discover it's based on research with a sample size of 20 of only the worst cases (and no concessions on if you may heal).

Another big offender is the redditmunity. For example /r/coronavirus now has almost A MILLION users (at the time of writing). With a group that big there is almost no filter on what a user can spew. I have seen people making claims about shit like ""My brother works for a financepany and they said we will need to switch to a gold economy after this"", ""10 million deaths is a gross and negligent underestimate, it will be 25 million"", and people literally claiming it's the end of humanity unironically. I have seen so many people make claims that world renown researchers and scientist are WRONG and they are RIGHT it makes my head spin.

The other issue with thesemunities is that ANYTHING remotely positive, or even mildly optimistic is immediately stamped out. If you post an article about how a very credentialed researcher thinks it may be ever so slightly less bad than ""we are fucked"" you will get called dangerous and downvoted out of existence. Some of these people do truly believe the this is the end, others are trolling, some are fantasizing, and others get off on the fear. There is almost no positivity allowed on many of thesemunities. If you find yourself having anxiety over Corona these are not places you should frequent

No amount of reading about bad things happening around the world is going to help you if you are already doing what is being asked of you as a citizen. If you are conforming to what the WHO/CDC ect are asking you to do there is nothing to gain by reading about horrible things happening elsewhere.

&#x200B;

**So What Am I Proposing**

If you find yourself struggling with anxiety over corona, or the news it is time to lower your exposure to it.

\-Do what you need to be doing right now (stocking a few weeks of food/hygiene products/medicines,practicing social distancing whenever possible, washing your hands, coughing/sneezing into your elbow, keeping an eye on symptoms, ect). Look for CDC/WHO guidelines on what you should be doing.

\-Wait and read any updates thate from Government/World Agencies (The CDC, WHO, The President, ect)

\-Follow your country/state/local authorities on twitter, or find their website that official updates are released on and follow it.

\-Otherwise do whatever you need to survive, remembering to try and eat well, sleep well, and try and exercise.

\-If you feel up to it check in on the news, but remember to have a discerning eye for sensationalism and bad articles

2401,"I Don't Think I'm Going to Live to See 2021 TBH The past few months have been an internal hell for myself. I have been battling serve anxiety since May after quarantining on campus between March and April. This was after a trip to San Francisco with my girlfriend the weekend before lockdown. Those two months were me, isolated in my dorm without friends and my girlfriend, and the first time in four years I had a suicidal thought.

I got back home to Los Angeles and got my COVID test. That same week, I had to be rushed to urgent care at one point due to an anxiety attack and found out I had an abscess the doctors had to remove. That Saturday I received my results and they were negative. However, I had my first ever panic attack and genuinely though I was gonna die.

Since then, I've had several COVID scares with my friend's mom being positive after I visited him and been tested four times with one antibody test. I went to get a check-up from the doctor for my anxiety issues and was toldI have severe anxiety, pre-diabetic, obese (256 pounds) and with high cholesterol, putting me at high risk for the virus.

I moved back up north to live with my girlfriend after my family told me they just couldn't handle my stress and anxiety anymore and just accept that the virus is out there. They've been out and about like nothing is wrong and my family back home has went to vacation to Arizona and Nevada despite the world crashing down.

When I moved in with my girlfriend, she and her family flew to Disney World to visit family. In the middle of the pandemic. I house sat for a week they were gone and quarantined elsewhere for another two weeks when she came back. This was the second time this year I thought suicide would be the best route out.

I had a dream telling me there is no escape and no matter what I do, I will die and there's no point to anything anymore. I take all the precautions, keep my distance, but even then, I've heard stories of people doing all that and still getting the virus and dying. I've told my girlfriend how I'm feeling and that I don't think I'm going to make it out of this at all. I told her that it's either the virus or myself, and I cannot let either win. I'm scared as hell still and I'm still worried I'll be dead before I even see 30. I'm afraid of getting sick, spreading it and passing away. Winter hasn't even came yet and I'm beyond terrified.

I love my family. We are a fairly cohesive unit (given everyone's developmental stages in life). I need space. We live in a 1000 sq ft mobile home with an indoor dog, an outdoor dog, and we just got 3 2 week old chickens. We just got a land survey and are working with an architect to build our forever home. My mom usually picks the kids up from school, and we have dinner with my parents about once a week. All of this has been put on hold. 

I am a fairly outgoing person. I feel so isolated and stressed. My little one is melting down twice a day (like laying on the floor kicking and screaming for 15+ minutes), my teenager regularly goes into rage mode when asked toplete a chore, and my husband has little to no patience for those things on a regular non-COVID day. I feel like I am handeling everyone's emotions and schedules and I. just. can't. anymore.

I just had aplete breakdown bawling painful chest caving crying over a damn spider (granted I am on my period, and am in need of a hysterectomy, but that's a whole other can of worms). 

I know this will pass. I know almost everyone is struggling right now. I just need a damn break. I can't keep my privilege in check right now because my brain is in crisis mode. I hate that about me right now, but I don't know how to fix it. This is such a unique and seemingly unfixable situation. 

My parents are both in 'vulnerable' health and age groups. I don't want to put them at risk by keeping the kids for a bit, even though my mom has offered. My cousin is our other usual babysitter, but she is also in the 'vulnerable' health category. I don't know what else to do. We have taken two 'dates' to run out and pick up food, leaving the kids at home. I hesitate to do this very often because they kids don't always get along and I worry that their usual screaming and crying and slamming doors may escalate when we are not home.

It’s frustrating because most of his job can be done from home and my state is experiencing the highest level of infection yet.

My mom, who was previously very healthy, was diagnosed with lung cancer this past May. It happened very suddenly- she's in her 60s and just got sicker and sicker until she had to be hospitalized in June. She's been in the hospital for over 70 days and just finished her last treatment but still has a lot of problems, namely lung issues.

My dad is an essential healthcare worker and a little aloof as a person-- he is a smart man but has some trouble putting 2 and 2 together sometimes. I've been SO worried about him catching the virus too because of the amount of patients he sees every day. 

When mom was first brought to the hospital, my brother, sister and I all went to see dad and had a socially distance visit on our enclosed porch that has windows. It was the first time in months that I had left my house. My dad rolled his eyes at the idea of keeping his mask on while we were all in the porch. We've now had about 4 of these visits with us out on the porch and i'm the only one still freaking out about not going inside the house, keeping the mask on, not using his bathroom, ect. My brother and sister no longer do these things when they visit dad, even though they both work restaurant jobs at the same restaurant. They've had many more visits there without me.

I would beg them both to quit, offered them money to keep them afloat until this whole thing was over because I didn't want to risk anyone getting sick. Moms doctors eventually allowed us to visit her one at a time. It's been amazing to see her, she's crawled her way back from being near-death to a stable condition, but she's still very ill and cannot leave the hospital. But i'm so constantly terrified that someone will bring something to her.

And now, last night. My sister texted and said she had a bad sore throat. She tested negative for flu and they tested her for covid but the results did note back yet. She was with my dad 2 nights ago(most likely inside, not on the porch), so my dad got the rapid test which came out negative this morning. Because he tested negative, dad went to go visit mom. 

But i'm so furious! Why would he still visit her, why isn't EVERYONE who saw my sister ISOLATING?! My mom is the definition of an ""at risk"" person. Those rapid tests have a large amount of false negatives! I'm such a mess, i've stressed over keeping everyone safe for so long and they all rolled their eyes at me and now this fucked up situation is unfolding and there's nothing I can do about it.

I felt like I was figuring other parts of my life out too, I was looking through a lot of job openings in nearbymunity colleges that I was qualified for, I was exercising consistently (I remember I had a goal to run for over an hour on this eliptical trainer at my gym by the end of February 2020, which I passed, only for the gym to shut down in the middle of the next month and I haven't been back since), I felt like I had ovee depression and was able to wean myself off of the medication I'd been taking for two years back in January, I felt like I was understanding how to make personal relationships work, I was ready to take on the rest of life.

Then within the span of about a week, everything changed, just as it did for everyone else. It all happened so fast, I went from full of hope topletely dashed of hope. It was like a guillotine, in retrospect. I haven't seen any of the students in the class that I taught or set foot in the library I worked in since March. It's really starting to imprint itself on me that I probably won't ever do that again, I might never set foot on the campus of a university I really enjoyed being a part of again. I had to return back to my parents' house during spring break because I lived alone and feared that I might take my own life if left to my own devices in lockdown.

I was mercifully able to finish the class I was teaching. Though it wasn't the same, I tried as hard as I could to teach as well as I could. I like my students to be hands-on in learning and I wasn't able to do that via a livestream but I made do with what we had. I received many kind messages from my students thanking me for giving them a good online class experience. If nothing else, I am proud of myself that I was able to do right by then at a time when it seems like they really needed someone to do so.

Since summer hit, though, I've felt so empty and dull. I had to scramble to finish my thesis, which was difficult because it covered the nuances of face-to-face tutoring, something that's impossible now and I miss dearly, so every time I tried to work on it for a period, I would just get sad. Thankfully, I'm done with it now, but I submitted it with no fanfare via e-mail and celebrated by drinking red wine alone by myself. I'm not going to get amencement or anything, I'm not going to try to get a cap and gown or the physical diploma at this point. It's just sad, I loved that school so much, I only spent two years there but it really had started to feel like home and I'll just never close the book on it the way that I wanted to. 

Now I have had to return home to live with my parents. I was thankfully accepted to a PhD program in late May, but it's in Canada and I have no idea when I'll ever actually be able to cross the northern border. Right now, getting into the country from the US is contingent on having classes in-person, which isn't the case for my program and I suspect that it won't be at least until next September. I'm considering asking them to defer my enrollment, which I suspect they won't be able to do, and I just have this sinking suspicion it's all going to fall apart any day now and I'll be back to square one searching for jobs living at my parents' house indefinitely.

There's no end in sight, which is so hard. That is the hardest part of it for me. There is nothing to look forward to. I have a daily planner that I wrote all the dates for concerts, sports events, movies, conventions I wanted to attend in back in like February and every time I turn the page on it I get hit with something else that got cancelled. I think that's an underlooked struggle here, there's just nothing in the calendar from here on out and there's no way to know when there will be something to look forward to. Plus just not knowing when the smaller horrors of this whole deal will end - the fear of sharing space with anyone else, not being able to see anyone's faces walking around, not being able to smile or show emotion in public, not being able to see friends or give hugs, having to wear the mask all the time, then knowing it'll continue into and past the Winter Holidays in all likelihood - that hurts too. Just recognizing that I'm not going to be able to go on a date has hurt too. I'm 25, I'm emotional, I'm romantically-inclined, and I desirepanionship and love, and I just know it'll be at the best a year before I'm even able toe close to feeling it. There's a deep underlying feeling of hopelessness to that too. 

I havee to the conclusion that this is not a life worth living right now, and I hate that. Especially so soon after I was living a life I genuinely loved. It all changed so quickly but the change to something worth living will take so long and I wasn't prepared for it, I don't think I'll ever get to the point where I can do much more than survive through it. I remember back in April or May I had this fantasy of going to sleep and not waking up, back then I dismissed it because I found it important to suffer and learn through this and grow, but right now I'd probably take the opportunity if presented. Hopefully, one day, life will be worth living, but right now it isn't and I just hope I find something to keep me going to that point. The thing I keep trying to remind myself is that, once I get the opportunity to do things I used to enjoy, I'll appreciate them more than I did before having had to be without them. I just hope that I can live through to that point without giving up. That's it though. I think if I had not enjoyed life before all of this, it wouldn't be so bad. I'm just sick of it all right now.",83,1,i5f5bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i5f5bv/i_am_struggling_and_need_to_put_this_out_somewhere/,33,Support,2020-08-08,-6,306,-0.0196078431372549
2414,"I feel like I'm losing a grip on reality Before this pandemic began, I was already barely hanging on day-to-day and suicidal ideation popped into my head on occasion. I felt like there was always a chance for things to get better, so I kept going despite how unsatisfied I was.

I was able to hold on during March, when my state (Kentucky) began to lock down, but ever since April or so I've been having panic attacks constantly. I wake up every morning feeling out of breath, and immediately go right into panic mode. I be inconsolable. Most of the time there's not even a single thing wrong with me, but death feels so inevitable in the hours that follow. I was diagnosed with asthma shortly thereafter, but I can't even tell if I really do have it or if psychosomatic symptoms have just taken over my body.

I just got married at the end of last year to the love of my life, and my life felt like it was starting to turn over a new leaf. We had planned on beginning the process of having children this year and even moving into a house at some point. But COVID-19 has taken all of this away, and I can barely cope.

I'm only 23 years old, but I fear that I will wake up one morning, gasping for air, and be taken away from my wife to a permanent end. I'm too scared to even sleep anymore and I stay up until the dead of night, waiting for my body to get so tired that I just fall asleep without even noticing it. On top of this, I nowpulsively take my temperature several times a day, in hopes that I can catch it early and somehow save myself. It's not even noon as I'm writing this, and I feel like I've already taken my temp at least 20 times this morning.

I'm terrified of having my life taken away from me so early. I don't even feel like I'm living anymore. Just surviving and waiting to see if I make it to the end of this okay. Between the chance of death, or losing all quality of life due to the effects of the virus, it doesn't feel like there's much to really live for.

Are there any coping strategies that anyone could rmend to quell my panic, or am I at the point that I need serious therapy?",81,0.97,hm9keg,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hm9keg/i_feel_like_im_losing_a_grip_on_reality/,23,Support,2020-07-07,-16,114,-0.14035087719298245

2419,"Saw some peers of mine start new jobs on social media. Feeling pretty bummed. So, first, obviously I'm happy for them. I don't wish that they didn't get their positions or anything like that-- it's more that it sort of triggered some not great feelings in me about my situation.

I got furloughed in April. I worked for a smaller business and they did what they could to try to keep us, but they got hit pretty hard by the shut downs so we got let go. Anyway, I've been applying to jobs for a couple months now and haven't gotten a call back. I used to work in digital media, but have widened my search to include other jobs that pay whatever amount could pay my bills. Despite that, not much luck.

I called a therapy center to see about scheduling an appointment, and aim to talk about it more in depth that way and everything, but was putting this here in the meantime in case anyone else is feeling similarly.

I feel an immense amount of dread every time I do job searching, maybe because I'm still upset that I lost my previous position (it took me forever to get a job related to my degree and for the first time, it was a job that paid mefortably). I imagine scenarios where I go broke or land in a job that hurts my health physically and mentally again. And simultaneously, I feel guilty for every moment I don't have a job, or I skip over applying to something that doesn't pay well enough or seems very high risk (I live with other people that I can't risk bringing sickness to. I just don't feelfortable with it.) And I think just seeing other people find positions made me feel really shameful, like I won'te through this or my not having a decent job is the fault of some inward flaw of mine, like I'm lazy or something, even though I know that lots of people are having this issue?

2420,"Is anyone else triggered by ‘We’re all going to get it eventually’ments? I guess those users mean well, but it’s incredibly triggering for my anxiety and OCD.

For one, I have 4 family members that have a high likelihood of dying if they catch COVID-19. I have my own health issues and no way of predicting what it could possibly do to me, but I doubt it would be mild. I’ve never had an easy time recovering from respiratory illnesses, and I have allergy-, anxiety- and exercise-induced asthma. 

To repeatedly read that I’m isolating myself for (probably) months but I’ll end up contracting the virus and potentially being hospitalized is terrifying and depressing. I just feel so uneasy thinking that all these measures aren’t for my health, but to ensure I’ll have a respirator  available to me when I’ll eventually need one. I haven’t slept well in weeks from the fear of getting the virus more than the sadness of isolation. At this point, I’ll be willing to remain isolated for all of 2020 just to not get the virus.

A friend of mine knows I've been having a really tough time and yesterday invited me out for a drive to get some food and just kick it, even prior to the virus I haven't seen this friend in months so I decided to just go for it. We drove around for like an hour, everything was honestly feeling pretty good. She invited me back to her place with her boyfriend and kid to hang some more and I was feeling too good to let the day end early so I agreed. So they've got a set up in the basement of this house, I was a bit worried about the close proximity but we weren't up in each other's faces but we weren't across the room either. For those few hours I played blocks and stuff with her daughter, we all talked and laughed, it was a really nice time that I needed. Time got away from us and before we knew it, it was after 1 in the morning and she offered that I can sleep over and so I did. I didn't really sleep that well cause I was freaking out we were all just passing the virus back and forth but morning came, and they dropped me back off.

They're both 27 and haven't been hospitalized or have dealt with any really heavy symptoms and I myself am 25 so I figured I can't lock myself in my apartment forever and I just took the plunge and wanted to have a good day for once.

2425,"I hate this ""the world has changed forever"" thing some people say ""This is the new reality"". ""World has changed forever"". All that sentences. And all of them are said with this sense, this feeling, that it is a very important and profound thing to say, and all the time they sound really vague and not very well explained. I mean, why this will change the world forever? I get it, we will have political and social changes, but that happens with any major event, it is not a big deal. After WWII, the world changed, but that doesn't mean we were at war all the time. I hate when people say those things in a very uncritical way, trying to sound ""wise"", it only brings more panic and sadness.

I mean, this is a virus, much probably we will have medicine and vaccines, and we have this herd immunity thing, I'm almost certain it WILL pass, and we will live sorta the same way we did before, without that social distance shit. So why saying in that ""insightful way"" that we have to ""accept it, the world has changed forever, but we still can be happy in new ways and blah blah blah""? C'mon, we are not babies and we are not stupid. I understand that could last months or some years at the worst scenario, but I can't see why that would last forever.

2431,"Want to rant about people being so inconsiderate. So my sister did part time in on a ski resort (some people who were at the resort were confirmed infected).

I think at some point she was coughing a little, and a bit later everyone there was coughing. After everyone had been coughing she came home about 1 or 1.5 weeks later. She said she thought she had  ""mononucleosis"" and not covid, because herplaint was that her throat nodules were swollen. I find it absolutely not believable at all though, and I think it's pretty obvious it's either covid, or a cold if she's already had covid.

Anyway, she's been home now, and she just does not care. I try to take precautions, but I wasn't really safe enough. I use a tool to not touch surfaces, and if I do I wash my hands, even if I just barely touch some part I know isn't safe... But, I only stood maybe 1 meter away from her when she talked to me, repeatedly, so I suspect my face got droplets.... And then I've touched my face, nose, eyes, and mouth, infecting myself (I really should have washed my face after every interaction, and worn a face mask).

I told her to use nitrite gloves and mask when she's in the kitchen, but she thought it was a bother so didn't. Told her to wear a mask when she was around me, but that was also a bother so she didn't. She's going to the city to meet friends, and now going away to a friend who's self quarantined because her/his parents didn't want him/her home due to having been sick at the ski resort.

Our 68 year old dad, who has a somewhat suppressed immunity system, is pretty desperate for social contact... So when she delivered him groceries he invited her for pancakes, but he does at least take some precautions like keeping distance. But still she should not have accepted, because he's at a real risk of actually dying to it.

I think I'm infected, and I know I should be fine.... But there's always the low chance of dying, and I think low chance of permanent damage (just turned 30, and generally healthy, but since allergies can give me breathing problems I'm a little worried). It's such an unnecessary risk, caused by people who don't care for others, and won't take things seriously because it's at odds with their own self-indulgence. It really makes me mad, it's one summer, and it's just some inconvenience to at least reduce the chances of me contracting it. It makes me mad, but serves no purpose to really confront her about it (I've told her what she's doing is stupid, and that she's one of the selfish ones we've talked about a month ago, she acknowledges it but doesn't really care), and I do have to blame my self for not just staying in my room.

If I die to this, I'm gonna be so mad (or won't, but you know). I hope I got lucky, but if not, I really really hope I won't be a severe case (not only for the psychological drain, but also because I'll probably fail my courses and have pretty big set backs due to that).",74,0.93,g78qdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g78qdo/want_to_rant_about_people_being_so_inconsiderate/,37,Support,2020-04-25,-22,152,-0.14473684210526316

2435,"Anyone else having major anxiety about working during covid 19? Could use support My anxiety has never been this high. I work in a group home for adults with disabilities currently, and needless to say I'm a people person. I love caring for others. I don't have the right tech set up to work at home nor could I see myself liking it at all....

I'm scared as hell at work. It's not a big house, and I work with 1 person at a time with 4 residents. However, while I'm not cross trained at other houses, many employees are. So they rotate around 2-3 group homes within thepany. Thepany has about 250 people, and so far 2 have tested positive from a different location within thepany and anyone who was around them is quarantining/getting tested. 

The job has good benefits and decent pay. Im full time and it still works with being a part time student. Thepany is pretty okay. But because it's hard to social distance in that small-ish house, I really worry about exposure. Obviously we have to eat on the job so we take masks off, and theres no separate area to go eat in like a break room just a small staff office. 

I'm 25 F, overweight but losing weight and eat healthy, take my vitamins/vitamin D. My boyfriend is one of the only people I see and he has asthma. He works as a cook at a restaurant but might soon quit as he wants to go to school full time. 

I'm considering switching to in home care where I have 1 on 1 clients, probably the elderly and have bo coworkers around me. It would be a little bit of a paycut and it wouldn't look quite as good on my resume, but would help with my anxiety.

2439,"Grocery delivery people keep showing up without masks. Do I leave ament about it in my rating? God, I feel like such a Karen for even asking this. But I want to preface this by saying I almost always give a good review, and I tip as well. Times are tough. And I also understand that there are people out there that have breathing issues and can’t wear a mask (though I’m wondering why they’re out grocery shopping for people all day if they’re vulnerable like that...)

HOWEVER. It makes me feel so unsafe when I tell people to drop my stuff off, and they wait at the door for me without a mask on instead of texting and leaving. I give clear instructions every time to just leave my things in the entryway cos I trust people at my apartmentplex and it only takes me a minute to walk down there. The only time I don’t mind people sticking around is when they have to scan my ID when I order alcohol. Or if they wait outside the door just to make sure I wave at them and grab my stuff.

I don't think I'll get to ever see 'Wicked,' or if I do, it might be years from now.

IF the cast continues to tour, IF the theaters are still even open then, would I even feel safe enough to go anywhere with a crowd?

How long until we're restricted from driving around the country?

When will travel be safe again? I really enjoyed cruising, I enjoyed going by airplane, train, or even bus sometimes. I enjoyed seeing other countries and tourist spots.

Judging just by what I see other places going through, this virus isn't only affecting if people live, get sick, or die. It will change our entire way of life.

2444,"Are we taking this all too seriously?! My SO and I have been very careful since March. They’re in a higher risk category and it’s actually been kind of nice to have a summer free some responsibilities and the ability to save money. Our family and friends have all also been pretty good about quarantining over the summer. 

However, I’m not sure if people are just “over it”, don’t care anymore, or the cheap flight prices are too tempting but we’ve been guilt tripped almost daily lately for not allowing friends toe visit (we live in a very touristy location), not returning to our home state to visit, etc. They’ve tried topromise by saying we’ll wear masks, etc. but that doesn’t make up for the fact that 1. We haven’t even been to a bar or restaurant since March 2. A mask doesn’t negate the fact they or we or them would be in a plane with potentially sick people or asymptomatic people. 

My question is are we taking this too seriously?! I feel like I’m losing my mind! A big reason we don’t want to get COVID or be exposed (aside from the unknowns, obviously potentially dying, and my SO being in a higher risk category) is that we’re both spending a ton of money to attend grad school - if we miss a semester due to being sick or our grades slip because one or both of us gets sick that’s literally thousands of dollars directly down the drain. Plus potentially our future.

YES, I'm doing poorly, because everything feels pointless and working isolated in your home with zero feedback from your team makes you doubt your every decision and slows you down.

The thought of picking up a call and being yelled at makes me freeze - I've been skipping calls to avoid it, because my PTSD has flared up very badly during all this shit.

I have anxiety, and I've been on therapy because of it for over 3 years. And I've spent almost 60 days without going past the walls of my house.

Talking to my friends through calls isn't enjoyable and distracting anymore. It feels like they are on other planet. It feels like no one cares about me at all. Absolutely everthing I had planned for the year is on its head. I have nothing. I have no one to talk to. Feels like I'm reliving the same fucking day over and over. Feels like time doesn't exist anymore. Even sleep isn't safe anymore since I'm having recurring nightmares.

For now, I'm not * actually * considering killing myself. I know I won't do it. But the idea of suicide is crossing my mind an awful lot these past few days. Thoughts like ""Would I actually die if jumped off my window?"" or ""If I were dead I wouldn't have to go through any of this"".

2456,"Think of quitting my job due to covid risk Tldr; Work in higher education and thinking about quitting due to risk of getting covid19. Not sure what to do.

I work in higher education. I teach in a technology lab and manage a team of faculty and student interns. The institution I work for is a minority institution that caters to non-traditional students. We start back at the end of August. I've been on campus with 5 other people in the building (masks & socially distant ) to prep labs before starting. While back on campus, I've been thinking and analyzing the following information and observations:

The institution will have a hybrid mix of online and face-to-face, and then regular face-to-face for some departments. Its been pushed by our administration to amodate students who struggle with online learning to hold classes in person. 6' social distancing and masks are required. Instructors must clean all surfaces and equipment after each class, that's it -- that's the plan from Administration. Administration will not provide anyone with masks, its bring your own. There is no plan for contact tracing. If you get covid, you have to use your sick leave that you've accumulated, and if you run out of that cause you've been sick for 3-weeks or more, you're SOL.

There are several faculty and people in administration that do not think this virus is serious. I've also observed that quite a few of faculty and staff do not wear masks appropriately. Some of them meet up for lunch together and carpool to their destination, and take off their masks when in the car.

Ive been bringing my own disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer to campus. The custodial team on campus is not very good at cleaning, and do not wear masks correctly, while cleaning. It has taken days to get soap refilled in the tiny bathrooms in our building.They also haven't refilled the lab cleaning wipes or hand sanitizer dispensers even though some faculty and student interns have returned. The bathrooms are poorly designed BTW, the stalls are small and there is no ventilation. The stalls have the partial doors but there is no door to the bathroom, just and angled open entry way from the hall. So if someone takes a big dump and are infected with covid, that toilet plume will travel into the hallway. 

Each of my lab rooms (4) have two small windows and can get very stuffy. There are too many high touch surfaces from equipment. The heating/cooling system for the building is also horrible as it sucks air from all the labs and offices and then recirculates it throughout the building. We've had issues in the past with the system not working correctly. So, air ventilation and circulation is a concern.

Cases of covid19 are exploding in this area. There are two hospitals, with abined number of 40 hospital beds, no ICUs, and 1 ventilator in the next county. 

A lot of the students (Ages 16-75) on campus are in a high-risk category for covid19. A handfull of my students have health issues like lupis, diabetes, and some are overweight

I have several students who have kids that will be returning to k-12 schools in the area. All k-12 schools are going back in-person, 3-6ft social distancing, masks optional. 

Even with the social distancing, cleaning, and mask wearing, there are other factors to consider such as counting on students to not have huge parties over the weekends. Also hope that students socially distance and wear masks appropriately, like don't give out hugs when they see their BFFing down the hall who returned from a weekend getaway with their extended family in another state. 

Am I crazy!? I feel like I've observed, analyzed, and noticed too many points of failure and significant increas in risk by returning to campus to work and instruct students. My students will most likely get the virus and its terrifying to me. I too will most likely end up with it, and I'm considered high-risk. I don't want to die or end up super sick with long term side effects from covid.

With everything I've observed and lack of leadership from administration, I feel like quitting my job. I have no job lined up, if I quit. I'm paralyzed from thinking too much about this, my anxiety is through the roof and haven't done anything for the last two days as I cant focus on anything except worrying about working and my students.

2459,"My Lockdown Story August 10, 2019: 12 years old, me and my father, a man of science who has reassured me through many of my fears and insecurities, stand in front of the foaming waters separating the bright and colorful Wildwood, New Jersey from the rest of the continental world. We gazed upon the beautiful oceans underneath the black sky glistening with blazing stars. As I saw this alluring view, I assumed that one year later, I'd be in this exact same spot, watching the stars with my father on the Wildwood beaches.

2019 was a year of discovery. On August 30, I started a website called The Societal Tribune ([societal-tribune.blogspot]( to pour my fascination with the prospect of a journalistic career into. 8 days later, and I turned 13, and I soon came to terms with my bisexuality (eventually revealing itself to be homosexuality). Beginning in November, I realized that I wished to be more like all the girls I knew from school, only my area's Conservative zeitgeist would prevent that, so I'd have to move to a Liberal area.

During my blissful hours at school, I became obsessed with several girls I knew - Ali, Isa, Jadah, and several others - who emulated exactly who I wanted to be. Every day, I'd aimlessly daydream about being like them. It was both saddening, as they had to be fantasies, but also reassuring andforting. I had several blooming friendships that made school even better - I was experiencing the bliss of socialization and learning.

In December, I discovered Green Day - my favorite band to this day. And, as the Hanukkah menorah burned a light into my family's dark kitchen, I celebrated the dawning decade ahead. This would be the decade where I would be an adult and free myself from my Conservative hometown. I had high hopes and I wasn't going to lower them before me were my hopes and dreams and I was just so excited.

Then, a few days after the beginning of the 2020s, I glossed over a headline containing the never-before-seen (at least to me) word ""coronavirus."" It didn't grasp my attention, so I scrolled by. A week later, a friend of mine in science made a joke about the enigmatic ""coronavirus."" In early February, a classmate was homesick and everyone thought they had the ""coronavirus.""

Soon, I heard more about the virus: from classmates, to teachers, to relatives. I learned from hearsay about the flu-like illness terrorizing China, slowly creeping into the rest of Asia and Africa. Soon, it made its way into Italy and the rest of Europe, as it's few blotches on the United States remained irrelevant.

However, I couldn't care. It was, to me, an issue irrelevant to my life that was unfortunate for the people that were directly affected by it. I felt bad for them, but hey - these were wonderful times, the best times of my life so far. I was hopeful for the future, I was borderline fanboying over Green Day, I was spending blissful time with friends, no coronavirus was going to get me down.

Then, it was March 13, 2020. A blissful Friday. I woke up, goofed off in science because hey, it was my worst class anyway (a D in a sea of A's), dazzled the teacher with my mathematical abilities, ate lunch, and sunk into the joys of English and history class. Then, as I walked home from school, my friend Alex told me that we had 2 weeks of school off because of a quarantine.

I didn't believe him. It was the most absurd thing I'd ever heard in my life - they were shutting down the school over a flu-like virus? So, when I returned home, I asked my mother and she affirmed the rumor. I was inraged, I ranted and ranted about how absurd that was. She agreed. When I stopped when got food for Purim.

My father agreed with the quarantine. I was shocked - my dad was the man always telling me things will be alright. That I shouldn't worry over nothing. I was bitter and annoyed for the rest of the day. A few days later, I began learning more about the virus.

It wasn't the coronavirus. It was *a* coronavirus called COVID-19, spread by the SARS-COV-2 virus. It wasn't a harmless fluesque condition, it was an extremely-contagious cold that has killed thousands. So, I began socially distancing.

But I was still expecting March 29, 2020, to be the end of the quarantine. I was so excited to see all of my friends again and resume my old life, virus-free. I was looking forward to the rest of seventh grade, to resume the best days of my life so far. But then, March 29 came, and the virus was still terrorizing mymunity, mainly because people wouldn't stay home. so, the governor extended the quarantine to May 8.

*THIS!* I thought *This - May 8 - will be the day I resume the rest of my life. It will be wonderful!* And May 8 arrived, but during Passover, the rest of the school year was canceled and moved online. It was here that I began to slide into terror and sadness.

I missed my old life. I missed the charm of pre-quarantine life. I missed the days where I woke up to enjoy learning and interacting. Before me was a terrible choice, a choice I had to make every second of every day - to either live my life and spread a pandemic or dwell in sadness and terror. I consistently take the latter option.

Every day I'd wake up, I shake in fear. I worried that the rest of my childhood would be consumed by the pandemic - the rest of my life. I worried I'd never return to school, that school would permanently be digital, even after the pandemic. I missed the days of school, friends, and restaurants like a septuagenarian looking back on the 1950s.

Then I began reading articles by hyperpessimists telling me I'd never talk to my friends again, that I'd never be in school again, that I'd never move to a more Liberal area and live my true life. Soon, I became convinced that they were right, and I tried to kill myself. I won't go into the details, but as the knight slid against my wrist, I felt at peace.

I was rushed to the hospital and survived. But I realized many things.

1. We've never had a permanent pandemic. Why would this mild pandemic (relative to other pandemics and epidemics) be the permanent one?
2. We made it through the Black Death in 4 years (1346 to 1350). That was in a medically ignorant time where people still believed in leeching and balancing humors.
3. We'reing very close to a vaccine - we could have one in September.

Despite this, I'm still lost and disoriented. I'm still anxious to return to school (although I signed up for online school until I get vaccinated) and my mother and brother keep filling my head with nonsensical pseudoscience and conspiracy theories.

Well let me tell you that I am having good days more than I am having bad days now!!  My feet and hands still give me some trouble but it’s better. Some days my legs really hurt but that is also less.  They just really hurt more when I stop. 

When I decided to not let it get me down anymore it really changed my life! I have been working out when I feel good which is most days. I just make myself do it and I feel so much better!! Sweating makes me feel better. 

I have been able to taste for sometime but I remember when it first came back!! It was amazing! 

Stay strong! And you can always text or call or just even hangout and talk.""

2461,"Navy doesn’t care My husband works at a smallmand. They went back to full manning a few weeks ago with a shady excuse. Now, surprise! 4 and counting positive cases. 2 more people showing symptoms. They sent home a few people, but definitely not everyone who was directly exposed. If you don’t have a positive test you don’t go home, even if you’re showing symptoms. Today they told the very few folks they quarantined that their quarantine time is now 8 days instead of 14 because most people show symptoms by then. 

I’m scared. Sad. We have four kids and for the first time in their life there’s absolutely nothing I can really do to protect them. My husband goes from work to the master and I’m sleeping on the couch between sanitizing everything and dropping him off food. I called everyone I could think of, every tip line I could find. One congressional office called me back and said “Try going up the chain ofmand because there’s nothing we can do, thanks for caring about health and safety.” 

I’m just spent. We’ve done everything right as an individual family. My children don’t deserve this, they’ve given up enough for the navy.

2474,"My sister is planning a large wedding in September. I don't know if it's safe for my family to be there. My sister is having a large, 250 person wedding in Wisconsin in September. I live in another state in the midwest. I am supposed to be standing at the wedding, as is my wife, and my 4-year-old son is supposed to be the ringbearer. I asked what she was planning for the wedding, and she said that the venue isn't requiring any restrictions, the waiters will wear masks and guests can if they'd like but don't need to, and they are very excited to have their wedding.

There are quite a few older people invited, my parents included, and I told her I don't think it's safe yet. I said that I'd go as I don't want to miss her wedding, but I didn't think my wife or son would be able to attend. I also said I probably wouldn't stay for the reception.

I wanted to tell her now so she could plan around this -- not having a ring bearer and one of your bridesmaids is pretty big, and she should know sooner than later. She said, ""if you want to burn those bridges, that's your decision."" The conversation got heated, and I said that a lot of people would probably choose not toe. She said sure, but those people weren't her brother (again, I said I'm going, but not my wife or son). I just want her to understand that the danger isn't over yet, and I want to be safe for my family and do my part of the social contract around COVID.

My parents (divorced) are on either side. My mom is going along with it, and trying to have it both ways, but I can't tell if she thinks there really is a danger here or if I'm overreacting. My dad thinks that it's ridiculous that she won't listen to reason, but she's an adult and will make her own decisions. My mom has told me my sister didn't want to have masks at all but is allowing my mom to buy and supply masks for the event. There aren't to be any masks in the pre-event pictures, however.

Am I being overly dramatic? I know it's three months away -- her response is ""I can't believe you're making this decision for something that's still 3 months away"". I'm open to amending my plans if I hear there's something to do to mitigate danger (social distancing in the event venue, limited invitees, etc, moving the event outside). But it sounds like she's not really making any changes to her plans, and I'm really frustrated that she's acting like nothing is different. She said to me, ""Do you really expect everyone to just quarantine for the next 5 years until they have a vaccine?""

I don't know. Am I being unreasonable? Should I have waited to say something? It doesn't sound like anyone else is saying anything, so I felt like I needed to say something, but maybe I shouldn't have.",68,0.95,gzrmaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gzrmaf/my_sister_is_planning_a_large_wedding_in/,28,Questions,2020-06-10,-4,124,-0.03225806451612903

Sure it's nice to talk about it to my girl who has been a huge help just with her being a big part of my life and we have brought each other a lot of love and care for one another.   


It's just lately things still feel very dull. Perhaps it's doing the same mundane routine without being able to go out to have fun to take a break from working and being stuck at home all the time. Not being able to travel to places that you loved to visit because of the virus. Honestly even if someone now were to ask me toe and hang out I just don't even have the desire to go anywhere. Now that I've just been a part of this going to work and going straight back to home routine it's just be part of my life now. It's weird right that you think someone who is depressed being at home and work all the time would want to go out, but at the same time you're concerned about the virus or your just so used to staying at home that it keeps me from wanting to go out.   


I am sorry I am sure what I am saying doesn't make sense and that it's the same feelings I share almost in every post, but lately that is how I have been feeling with nothing really changing about it. Honestly I would say the only time I am happy is when I am with my girl, but I know I can't be with her 24/7 and it just doesn't help that both of our work schedules keep us pretty busy. I am honestly at the point where a lot of the time I just break down and cry or I don't feel the same enjoyment I've felt when it'se to my interests whether they were indoor or outdoor interests. It almost just feels like the virus has taken the joy out of my life and I am sorry it's selfish to even think that way when I should be grateful that I am alive and healthy. Guess in my mind if I can't be happy then what's really the point in living other than to be with those around you that love and care for you.

2482,"Mad that our quality of life depends on others, or mainly that our state is somehow tied to the late response of federal government Well, right now i have a lot of encountering  feelings.
I'm mad because of the increasing  number of Covid-19 cases here at Mexico (today the number is up to 14677 confirmed cases,  including 1351 death's. And I have seen a lot of people plaining on internet in both ways, some that is fake,  is a scheme to ""slave us"" and the government control us... but also people thatplaints that the government is NOT testing enough, the numbers are faked to be ""too low"".

However, something else is added: it's clear that there is a political fight involved too. If the numbers are right, my home state, despite having the second or third most populous city in the whole nation, the numbers of confirmed and death  are pretty low, evenpared to other less populous states (282 confirmed cases, 25 deaths here at Jalisco). God, we are even on the last 3 places on number of cases per 100,000 people,  that should be something to notice... but nope, Federal government is ignoring and still accusing that we are not doing enough...
Hell, here the state ordered to everyone use masks from the Monday in public places, there's a lot of problems since a lot of business are closed to help slow the disease,  I even had to go home with half salary since our workplace must have massive events to work, and we are ""offline"" since late March, following states orders an so.

What I'm angry,  is that we started to make sacrifices, a lot. Yes, a lot of people isn't helping,  even some idiots dare to assault healthcare workers. But also a lot is making everything possible so we can survive this. Dammit, even the local churches switched to make all the celebrations,  including holy week, via live streams on internet so people don't need to go physically to the temples. Schools started home education earlier than other places, massive events cancelled,  bars closed... the response  of our state was early,  even other states followed us and joined the efforts with the same actions... but the federal government still dismiss us, telling that we are doing wrong...

Funny thing: tomorrow the federal government is issuing the orders to wear masks in public, we already had been a week there... and unfortunately,  the main issue I see, is that what happens  on Ciudad despite Mexico,  can affect tottaly other states,  caused by the fact the nation is heavily centralized...

The guy I'm dating went to see his parents and I won't see him for 2 months. I used to look forward to seeing him once a week, and it helped a lot. He's been gone for only three days and it just seems like forever.

And then yesterday I lost $300 from my pocket and I feel so stressed to the point that I didn't sleep last night. On normal circumstances I usually would just let it go but I felt so gutted.

2487,"Why do I believe when I get this, I will pass away? Is it because of all the reports of how many people passing away? Where are the reports of people feeling sick for two weeks and recovering? Why am I so convinced that I’m going to die from this virus? I’m a normal 24 year old, I can eat more vegetables and less junk food but so can a lot of people. Is it because I’m always negative my whole life and now it’sing to fruition? Is it because it’s better to think negative and not expect for something good to happen? Is it my depression talking?

2489,"Employer singling out employees that wear a mask at work. 

I work for a call center I.T.pany. We do IT remotely for over 500panies in the State of NJ where the COVID-19 numbers have been one of the highest in the country.

During Phase 1 (from March through May), we had a perfect work from home infrastructure and our technicians thrived. Our ticket counts were the lowest they have been in years, all while working from home. All our clients were paying us and our owner still qualified for government assistance for over $5 Million that I'm pretty sure he doesn't have to repay. We are NOT hurting financially at all.

In New Jersey, Phases 1, 2 & 3 all require that office workers work from home if at all possible. While still in phase 1, my employer started to mandate that all employeese in the office (even though we had a perfect work from home infrastructure in place).

This wasn't quite what bothered me though. What really bothered me was the fact that when you got to the office, there wasn't any safety precautions put into effect. All the employees were walking around without masks. Anyone that didn't have a mask was called out by our bosses and made to look childish and ipetent. They attacked us mentally and made snarky remarks in front of all our co-workers. They essentially demean you until you give up and remove your mask. They also called large meetings into a small conference room where employees were forced to stand shoulder to shoulder without any PPE.

I've worked here for over 5 years and I'm yet to experience this type of toxic work environment up until this point. It almost feels as if they are trying to push their political agenda on you.

I'm not sure what to do. They are still in fact paying the bills, but at what cost? Should I just shut-up and color, or should I stand my ground? If I choose the latter, what are my options?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm quite lost right now and mentally exhausted over this matter.

2491,"Grandma and Grandpa passed away from Covid-19. Feeling anxious and helpless. TLDR: Grandpa and Grandma have passed from Covid-19. My SO is in a country that refuses to quarantine. 

I typed out my post earlier this morning you can see it below this paragraph. I’m too tired to change it. But since this afternoon my grandpa has also passed. My mom has been sobbing throughout the afternoon and she’s feeling terrified. This whole situation is surreal. From dealing with planning a virtual funeral to seeing my grandpa’s body through video feed, it’s just unbelievable. Earlier I was feeling powerless and now I’m just horrified. 

TLDR: My grandma passed away from Covid-19. We are holding a virtual funeral due to quarantine. And my SO has asthma and I’m not coping well. 

My grandparents have never been very close to me/my family. My mom has been estranged from them for the past 4 years. They live in New York and recently contracted Covid-19. We were contacted by my cousin and luckily my mom was able to contact my grandma when she could still talk. My grandparents are/were in their 70s/80s and grandma wasn’t as healthy as my grandpa. Grandpa is still hanging in there but recently my grandma passed away and everything is surreal. Normally we could drive to NYC to help out and handle things. But with the spread of Covid-19 and the state of NYC we can’t go there. My mom couldn’t see grandma in the hospital and can’t see her now that she’s passed. My mom has been calling to set up the funeral but we cannot attend in person. And to add to this surreal feeling the funeral will be live streamed to us and other family members. 

Now that the disease in closer than ever to my family I’m feeling terribly anxious. My SO is in another country that isn’t taking the proper precautions to prevent the virus from spreading. He has to go to work everyday and soon he will be transferred to a rural area right outside of a huge city. He has asthma and I’m petrified. We talk everyday and the thought of the virus just looms in the background of our conversations. We bring it up every once and awhile but the both of us just get silent. It’s terrifying to acknowledge how dangerous Covid-19 is. I feel so powerless and anxious.

Edit: So the virtual funeral was held yesterday. It was as surreal and absurd as we thought it would be. The funeral directors were wearing masks while placing the caskets in the grave. We said last words through a phone conference call. There was no pastor and everything was rushed. The funeral home was so busy they never even processed the second payment for my Grandpa. 

Two days ago we found out where they likely contracted the virus. They had been mostly isolated, and for necessities their carer would buy groceries and leave everything at their door. But despite this effort they still chose to attend church weekly. A few other attending members had contracted covid-19 as well (We had called their family doctor who gave us this information). So this is likely where they got it from. Please urge your loved ones to stay away from large gatherings and keep isolated at home. 

Some happier news, my SO is doing well and  hispany has put in new protocols to keep everyone social distancing from one another. Thepany did this on their own, without and pressure from the government. I feel more at ease.

Also I’m not sure if anyone will see this but shoutout to NYC heath workers, customer service workers, and funeral home workers. You guys were really amazing. There was never a hurtful or cold word said. Despite the situation everyone was unbelievably kind. The nurse in charge of my grandparents tried to amodate my mom as well as she could despite the danger. The hospital workers who transferred our calls were always so sweet and had said condolences when they heard the news. The man at the security/lost in found counter was so patient and informative as well as kind when we were trying to figure out where my deceased grandparents stuff was.

2493,"Frenchman on lockdown. Starting to feel relaxed. Hi everyone, hope you're all fine!

As you know, my country, France, is now onplete lockdown since Tuesday at noon. Nothing really interesting to read here but I just wanted to talk about  my new ""lockdown routine"" and how I'm starting to feel more relaxed each day.

It was the strangest feeling I ever felt in my entire life, seeing our President saying those words six times on TV: ""We're at war."" Half of the population saw this live: an absolute record. Hearing the fact that the next day at 12am everyone will be on lockdown. Just imagine for a second what we all felt. My heart was beating like crazy, my wife waspletely silent, we stayed in front of the TV, speechless, listening to this, imagining what wille next, preparing for the worst. We knew for a fact that lockdown would happen like in Italy but, when you hear it live on TV, it'spletely different. Will there be riots in grocery stores? Wait how long? It's ok don't worry! Will we see the army on our streets? Are the shops going to be closed? We'll be okay! Wait. Is this it? Are we really living this? You name it. It was really something.

The first day of lockdown, some people (of Paris mainly, sadly) rushed to big train stations, wanting to get out of their big cities before lockdown, not listening to the fact that we SHOULDN'T go out at all costs. They were all packt like sardines in a crushed tin box. They probably made the biggest mistake of their life and everyone in France was really shocked, but, yup, only time will tell.

Two days on lockdown passed by. We're at home with my wife. Of course, we're not able to see our friends, to see our families, our neighbors, to go at the park or things like that. We can only go out to do ""essential"" things like groceries / go to the pharmacy / walk around the house / family emergency. We can't go out unless it's an absolute necessity. And if we want to do so, we have to print an official paper, date it and sign it, in case of control by the police (we don't have a printer at home so we have to copy it by hand, a bummer, plus we have to copy ALL of it word for word, a normal process in order to discourage people). Needless to say it was a bit strange getting out the first time for some grocery shopping, the atmosphere was almost Half-Life 2-esque. I talked with the manager of my local shop that I know very well, and she's doing ok, I don't know why but it warmed my heart talking to her and her husband. I saw social distancing on the streets but honestly it didn't felt *that* apocalyptic, just different.

Now, we try to read the strict minimum of news, just staying informed of important things. Ipletely stopped reading Reddit hours a day, scrolling furiously r/coronavirus and others, putting my phone down at 4 am falling asleeppletely exhausted. I just stopped doing this. My anxiety was too high and I thought: what's the deal? What's the point? My life is right here, right now, in this house. Nowhere else. I just need to keep being informed of important things, stay in touch with people I care about and nothing else. It was hard to stop but, it was necessary.

Now for the good news. Honestly, lockdown is something but it's not *that* bad. The weather is absolutely beautiful over here, 20 degrees C (68F) and a blue sky. Instead of worrying all the time about the end of the world as 1/2ment on some subs and forums says on Internet, we're just doing normal or wholesome things. Well, beside the fact that my delivery of Animal Crossing I ordered a week ago appears to just be stopped somewhere, everything is fine. In the morning, we watch cartoons like we were kids, some Pokémon, eating our breakfast and coffee. Rest of the day we're working and listening to some music. We were never fan of working before (attention: kids are living inside our 30 year old heads) but honestly, it feels very good, thinking about your work, being focused, and feeling aplished at the end of the day. Our flat is very small but whatever, we actually don't care that much. We play some Stardew Valley, too. Some Rocket League. Some Zelda. We have to be together and move on together and keep fucking hope, like what's written on Trunk's time machine. [Hope]( Tonight we'll re-watch some Ghibli films. Can't wait.

Yesterday night, we drank some beers on our balcony (thanks to our neighbors that handed us a table and two chairs because our balcony should have been under repair this month, and we sold everything two weeks ago, bummer). Everyone was drinking at their own balconies or gardens, it was actually pretty funny (we're living in the suburbs of Bordeaux). We talked with our neighbors from afar. People we never even saw or talked with before. One of them even played guitar for us all, asking what we wanted to hear. So simple, yet so relaxing. At 8 pm, EVERYONE clapped their hands (to thank the workers of the medical field). So heartwarming too.

Yesterday night was a good night and so is today. So. Silent. No city sounds, just birds chirping. It's weirdly relaxing. It was a long time since I heard birds from my apartment. It's so cool. I tried to recognize which sound corresponded to which bird but it's VERY hard actually. I waved at my neighbors from afar, thing I never did before. We smiled at each other like hey, you're also wearing pyjamas? A kid was playing with a Switch (or was it a Game Boy Color? No way) in a garden. I don't know. I felt cool.

Well, yes, we're living something we only saw in things like SF films or games like The Division. Yeah it's very impressive. We know. But I firmly believe that even if it's gonna be some hard confined months ahead, we'll be somehow okay. We'll find a way. We even should take advantage of this quarantined time to focus on what matters the most. Oh and unsubscribes from r/collpase and r/coronavirus, instead sub to r/wholesome or I don't know what you like the most. Or do something else. Write me a message if you feel stressed. I'm an asthmatic, maybe we can talk about this? I don't know. I love video games, if you want to talk about this too.

Well. We will saw nice thingsing from all this. I can feel it. Honestly we're starting to feel relaxed. We have no choice but getting through this.

2496,"I was concerned about staying with family while a member of the household was still attending school... my concern has been justified... I don't really know what to do I’m feeling a bit helpless to the situation right now and could really use some advice. 

I posted a few times about my concern with the UK’s handling of the situation. I was shocked because I had juste from New England, where I’ve seen people being very cautious, to London, where it seemed like nobody cared. As you may know, the UK’s cases have skyrocketed and are doubling every week. 

My husband and I quarantined in the city, and after spending that much time in our tiny flat we thought that it would be better to go to his parents’ home in scotland, since case numbers are lower there and if we’re going to be locked down, we wanted to be with family, with more space, and more mobility.

My only apprehension was that my husband’s youngest sibling was still attending school, and I was worried that they could possibly spread it to the family. Each time that I expressed my concern and difort about this with my husband he said that there was no data to prove that it was a risk (no data but as we should all know by now, the data is only what we know for certain, you have to read between the lines to figure out what might actually be happening). He felt like we were more likely to get sick in the city than we would be if we went to his parents. He felt like I was over reacting.

I also posted here about my concern and others said that it was probably an over reaction and again, there wasn’t enough data to support that kids going to school could be a driving factor in infections within households.

Well… 

We found out that a friend of theirs just decided to pull their kids from school on their own accord because of an outbreak in the school district that the entire families of several students got sick from. My husband’s family hasn’t decided to pull their sibling from school yet, and I’m just worried that it will be too late when they do. 

I just feel like I’m at everyone’s mercy. I’m a little bit frustrated with my husband for dismissing my concern and not entertaining the fact that this could be a real possibility. I’m not going to ask them to pull his sibling out of school, that isn’t my place. I’m also not going to leave or go back to the city myself. I also can’t just avoid everyone - we have meals together, we watch movies together. I’m not going to be a jerk and hide in my room.

Quite frankly I'd rather die than live like this for that long. I don't care what anyone says I cannot function like this till a vaccine.

Literally 90% of anything I enjoy doing is a non essential activity. Restaurants, salons, shopping, concerts, travel. All fucking canceled for the foreseeable future. I've been going on walks sometimes & playing video games which I do enjoy, but after nearly 2 months of this shit that isn't even enjoyable anymore.

I still have a job which I'm thankful for ie. But I literally cannot continue to work from home. It's 10x more stressful than going to the office & it's so hard to get things done & stay organized. I literally sit at a folding table in my kitchen with my laptop & cry all day because I'm so stressed. Literally the only good thing is when 5pmes and I can start drinking. 

I haven't seen my friends and literally idk when I will be able to hang out with them again? I can't do any of my self care that normally helps me de stress a bit (getting a manicure or even a fucking hair cut). I've spent hundreds of dollars on concert tickets & travel for this summer & the majority of them have all been postponed already. I hope I'll be able to do some of these things in the fall but I fear that it's just simply gone forever.

A few weeks ago when this all started the 1st goal was to slow the spread. I was fine with that. Then it became give the hospitals time to prepare. That was also fine. Now where I am the goal was/ still is testing. Frustrating, but fine. Now with each passing day the narrative seems to change/ get closer to lockdown forever or until a vaccine. That I seriously don't think I can live with. Even on our local news it seems like they've replaced ""temporary new normal"" to just ""new normal"" and that's terrifying.

I sound like such a pathetic spoiled brat but I genuinely feel I  will never have fun again. I don't even know why I'm posting this.

2508,"I'm at my limit. I don't think I care about the virus anymore. Edit: I wanted to let everyone know that I've been feeling a lot better after recieving all these responses. I've taken a lot of your advice and have been trying to implement new habits, and I've spoken to my girlfriend and family about the situation. As of right now I'm on my way out of the trailer, and I'm trying to figure out ways to stay isolated while also staying in thefort of my home. I'm sorry if I didn't respond to everyone immediately, I took a break from social media to relax for a while also. And finally, people here have expressed that they like my writing and should continue to do so. I was very flattered by this, and decided that if I write something about my experiences that I'm confident in sharing, I'll consider sharing it in the future. Have a good dayeveryone, and thank you for all the amazing support :). I'll be leaving the rest of this post up in case anyone else wants to read it. 

I would like to start this post by saying that I understand that the virus is affecting millions of people worldwide, and many of these people have be sick and/or died as a result of this virus ororbidities that were exacerbated by the virus. It is not my intention to disregard this fact in this post, I'm genuinely looking for advice or support on this subreddit. Again, I don't intend to break isolation and expose people recklessly, or disregard the many individuals impacted by this pandemic. 

 For some background I work on an inter facility transport ambulance, I won't say where. Most of my job these day's revolves around transporting COVID positive patients between facilities in order to keep them isolated from the general public. This means I visit the many hotspots around my county, from Nursing Facilties, private residences, ICU's, Emergency Rooms, or other specialty facilities. On top of this in order to protect my family and friends I've self isolated in an RV, as it was my only option. I've started this isolation since roughly March 12, when things began to get shut down around my country. I live in a shitty area where people set fireworks off at night, theres a car chase or major crime that happens at least once ever 2 weeks, and I live right on the edge of a canyon which means I frequently get to hear the local junkies have their fun at night nearby. 

Anyways, to get to the point of this post. The title of this post captures everything I've been experiencing emotionally the past two weeks. I think I've reached a point where I don't care if I get sick anymore, and if I catch it and die I'm kind of chill with it all. I've seriously tried to stay optimistic about the whole situation and give a shit, but at this point I'm over it. Transporting COVID patients is so fucking draining. A COVID call goes like this. First, we suit up in our PPE. Our PPE is actually quite goodpared to some places because we've improvised a bit, which consists of a used N95, surgical mask, two pairs of gloves, a pair of glasses, faceshield, and a raincoat as a gown. In this regard we're lucky, but wearing it sucks. After 10 seconds of wearing your PPE in 90 degree weather you begin sweating balls. The raincoat traps your sweat, which then evaporates from the heat, and then repeats this process until you have your own personal sauna. The face shield and glasses then fog up so you can hardly see, and your N95 and surgical mask is so difficult to breathe through I've heard coworkersplain of feeling dizzy. You're a minute in to this call. You stay this way for an hour. Go into the facility, you're generally greeted by outdated policies from some staff withplaints about whatever bull shit they wannaplain about. Pick up your patient, which is generally asymptomatic and ok. Sometimes they aren't, like the guy I found in respiratory failure. While trying to treat him I couldn't even see his face through my PPE, and it was so hot when a piece of my gown slipped I dripped sweat from my arm on to his shirt collar. Whoops. Also, your rig is from the 90's and doesn't have AC, have fun!! And the vent used to expel air particles is so loud you can't hear anything else, so not only can you hardly see or breathe, you can hardly hear over the constant WWHIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR of the vent. Bring the patient to whatever place hes going to while trying to stay sane and safe, drop him off while dealing with staff again, and then deep clean your rig for the 4th time that day. While cleaning you try to remember everything you touched, everything they touched, anything they coughed on, etc. At a certain point you begin to care less, until you begin to think of stuff like ""if I lick the bench seat maybe it could just be over with and I'll either have immunity or be dead"". You finally doff your PPE, and you look and feel like you ran a marathon. Sweat all over, literally dripping off you, you turn to notice a lady eyeing you suspiciously at the bus stop. ""Yup, I'm fuckin infected. Now quit looking at me."" Then the tablet rings, notifying you of your 5th COVID call that day. You're 6 hours into your 12 hour shift. 

Anyways, doing this 4 days a week has left me exhausted. On top of this my family keeps telling me bull shit like ""stay cautious!!"" or keeps telling me about all these COVID facts over the phone. I love them, but its driving me crazy cause they have no idea about what's going on in real life. Theres only so  cautious I can be when I go to a patients house and have to break in through the window, because I can see him face down on the floor when I peak through his curtains. ""Welp, looks like I'm breaking into a house for the first time, better be fuckin cautious!"". I just can't be cautious to the level they expect me to be, its humanly impossible not to slip up. I've been living alone, eating terribly, I'm exhausted, I'm constantly reminded of it by my family on my off time, I can hardly see my girlfriend or friends, and half my week I'm speaking to the people or treating the people who have it. I'm sick of it all, I don't care anymore. Let me get it already, even though I probably already do. I wanna sleep in my bed, my actual bed, in an actual home, in a home where the toilet has water in the bowl and flushes without assistance, where the bathtub doesn't overflow after a week of showers, and I can use wifi liberally for my youtube subs. I wanna stop being treated like the plague by loved ones and strangers, and I want to be left alone by the weirdos who feel the need to thank me for shit they'll forget about when it blows over. I want to be able to run calls that I don't feel mentally and physically exhausted after by default. I don't want to be bitched at by staff at a facility because they ran out of gowns on the behalf of their management forcing them to use them for stupid reasons. I want to be less tired. Stop going out strangers, stay inside, and to the people staying inside: calm down a little bit.

2510,"The truth of covid-19 from someone recovering I want to do my best here to get you in on the ground floor.

Just a quick overview of my situation. I am 33 and had some of the worst symptoms of covid-19 you can get. I however had noplications and so did not need a ventillator, meaning my case is moderate. Though I did require hospitalisation and this is how my infection was confirmed.

I have had some time now to consider how everyone is feeling, what people really fear, and all sides of this crisis; from the health staff, to the patients, to those with mild symptoms, and those withplications, to those at home without enough information.

In short I will explain that covid-19s hardest hitting symptoms can absolutely affect the young (if you get them), and there is nothing saying you won't get the worse symptoms because of your age. The difference is in the COMPLICATIONS those symptoms can trigger. So, I was told, that my symptoms were ""right in the middle of the worse cases"" and ""if you were 20 years older... it would be another story"". However, my body was able by some miracle I don't understand, hold off infections like pneumonia, and hold offplications.

At the second recurrance of the worst of my symptoms I was hospitalised in something called a hot zone. This is for people with a fever over 38, there are warm zones 37 and above, and cold zones 36 etc. In this zone I was taken into an isolated treatment bay, where about 8 vials of blood were taken for different tests, and I was given xrays for my lungs.

At the time my heart rate was 125, and I was short of breath, but I was able to remain calm, and get enough oxygen. In the bay across from me was someone else, also with a heart rate of 125, but not okay. It was a stark example to me, of how the same symptoms can have a different IMPACT.

And this is when covid-19 became clear to me, that the distinction is not in symptoms, but in theplications that they create. This is where disaster strikes from. Just one weak link and the bombardment can show its cracks. And it is not an unsignificant bombardment if you get the higher end symptoms.

I realise this might terrify some of you who suffer anxiety, but I say it in order that you not be under prepared. And there is HOPE in this reality, even though dark. Hope to understand the disease and what you see around you, and hope in how to get through it and what to expect.

So let me get into how that hopees about and how you should react to the disease if you get it.

Hopees in the form of symptoms being different fromplications. You can have the worst symptoms, but be checked forplications, and after monitoring, and patient recovery be cleared (as in my case). And understandinges in the form of knowledge that pneumonia is the mostmonplication. Though this can change and I expect that is why they took 8 vials of blood instead of 1 or 2.

We can treat pneumonia, and this is the biggest source of hope out there when you are worried. And even if scanse back with it, there are good chances of you fighting it off.

While it is true we have nothing for covid-19 itself, we CAN face itsplications in many cases.

How does this help us understand what is in the media?

Well, there are things that are wrong... Namely ""it is a cold, or a flu"". No, the symptoms are not like that at all and can hit so ungodly hard that it will shake you to your core. But that said, that is the SYMPTOMS not the oue.

OUTCOMES are similar to the cold and flu, (given treatment) because we can mostly treat for the same or similarplications.

These muddling up of these two facts is the reason for disinformation. If you assume the symptoms can only be as tough as a flu, you will get cocky (far too cocky about this disease) and you will be shocked when someone as young as 21 dies. But if you understand that the symptoms can be quite extreme, you will understand how much pressure a person is under and whyplications might occur in the young.

The symptoms, are however distributed on a scale. Right now the scale is measured in literal temperatures but I am sure that will change as they get more understanding of it. If you get low end of the scale symptoms you will just feel a bit weak, maybe have a few bursts of a few hours of bad fever or symptoms, a few aches, etc. Mid range, you might feel short of breath, nausea, lose appetite, cough a lot (some have fits of coughing others dont), get a high fever, mild disorientation, fatigue, and headaches. High end of the range, shortness of breath, inability to speak, move, go about normal activities, not be able to feed yourself etc, shaking, disorientation, confusion, (amongst other symptoms, cuz there are a lot of symptoms thate on and they differ for different people).

Most of the symptoms show around the 4-5th day, it might be only for that day, it might continue, or it might reoccur, and in the 7th and 9th days are whenplications seem most likely.

I was hospitalised on the 7th day mostly in order to check forplications as my symptoms were very severe, and basically were similar to a heart attack according to paramedics who were making sure it wasnt one, and friends who looked on.

8th day now... the onset of symptoms today were bad but... only for an hour, and weren't so bad as the day before and certainly not as bad as what I had on the 4-5th day. I must be vigilant in theseing hours and days, but I know I am going to be okay.

So, I wish to give you some of my strength and resolve.

If you are afraid,

Do not fear the unknown out there in the media.

KNOW the facts.

Symptoms will be on a scale, those symptoms will change over the days of the infection, and while they are bad and they may cause you panic, do not panic, instead be smart. Moderate to mild symptoms are unlikely to causeplications but you want to make sure, preferably with your GP if you are registered for one, as they can give you antibiotics for anyplications early on, where paramedics and the like cannot. And the hospital will be dealing with life and death, so not have a lot of time to spend with you in the hospital bay. So if you can, it is morefortable to use your own doctor. BUT if your symptoms are severe, I think it is probably a must to get it checked out with xrays and bloods.

Understand that this virus, is very physically demanding. And in turn you must react intelligently. You must use your wits, and stay calm, in all situations. You will not have the energy for worry, or deep thought, all your oxygen will be going to your cells to help fight the virus.

My number one tip is this... support from those who live with you. And checkins from people who know you over messenging services. Have them wear ppe (protective equipment) but having people there can help you ovee hours of otherwise staring at the wall trying to keep calm (you wont be well enough to listen to music or talk, or think at all if your symptoms are significant enough).

Be careful throughout the entire two weeks. And find ways tofort yourself. For me it was sitting upright cuz I had less pressure on my chest, and soft slow breaths, no fast movements that would rise my heart rate more (I listened in my body for my blood pressure rising and kept it low)

Remember, the symptoms are not like the flu, the oues can be... BUT, know that because the symptoms are significantly more physical than the flu significantly more worrying and frightening when intense enough, thatplications are less predictable and this requires vigilance and support through the process.

Knowing all this you should be better prepared.

***Action plan:***

***Dont fear the symptoms, instead measure their severity... if they are significant enough to causeplications, get ahead of theplications with the gp at the early stages (4th -5th day) for now dont take them to the hospital(unless you feel it is fitting to your situation) as if it isnt covid you dont want them to get covid. But if it is day 6-9 and the symptoms are severe you need to be sure there are noplications.

2521,"To Dentist, or Not to Dentist. So this may sound stupid but here's the short summary.

I needed some dental work done urgently. I would have waited on it if I could have, however, I had formed a surface cavity ( front of tooth ). And the worry with a surface cavity is that if left untreated for too long, it can quickly go from ""You need a $200 filling"" to ""You need a $1,200 crown in order to save it"". (This is the sad reality when you're young and think you're invincible to everything and can do whatever without consequence -- it always catches up a bit later).

As far as personally. I've been cautious about COVID as far as making sure I'm not sticking my fingers around my face, washing hands, etc. But not to the point of wrapping myself in saran wrap and saying that the world is going to end. Just normal ""well covid is a thing, got to be careful"".

When I walked in, there was no one there but secretaries, but 5 minutes after I sat, 4 people came in too. So I'm not sure how they're scheduling things. As far as precautions, all I saw was just the quick temp check, and you sign a form that says ""You understand bying here, you are risking catching COVID"". And when I saw that, it hit that ""Dummy, you're in a dentist's office with COVID"". But I signed it because the work needed to be done.

I guess the main concern is I've heard a lot of dentists using face shields, etc. But my dentist walked in with the typical surgical mask on, and didn't wear it until he started the work. I guess I just thought maybe a bit more precaution would be taken. Especially since hees in contact with dozens per day, and if anyone is going to transfer it, it would be him and the assistant.

I'm not sure if I'm asking the stupid question of ""are dentists safe"" AFTER the fact, or just venting off concerns. Everything with COVID is a toss-up right now, including the whole ""are you healthy"", because there's been cases of even healthy people getting it and being serious. And I definitely don't want to get to a hypochondriac like mind-set where every little symptom is an ""Oh god, maybe it's COVID"". Like I said; I acknowledge that it's a thing, and I take extra steps to not catch it, but I'm really starting to feel like going to the dentist during this was a horrible choice, for something like a cavity. Where you decide ""Do I want to keep the tooth, or my well-being"".

And of course, I now have an appoint next month for a checkup, and to do a few more things.

2522,"Frustrated. So I'm based in India which is important context for everything that follows. Most middle /upperclass folks in India are used to having people from outsidee once a day and clean and cook (""domestic helpers""). Yes. This must be pretty shocking for a lot of the non-Indians here, but that's what it is. Note also that in India, the corporate culture expects you to be available almost 24 by 7 and the only reason folks in my place were able to manage jobs and housework was on the backs of employing other people to cook and clean for them. 
Of course, once my country's lockdown started in March, this couldn't go on. So people of my privileged class got a taste of what it's like to fend for oneself as well as work full time. Husband and I learned to cook, clean and manage.

This was all fine till recently when everyone including the govt seems to have started getting lockdown fatigue.

Long story short - my in-laws who are both 60+ and stay with husband's 80+ grand parent are getting two people toe in and cook and clean everyday. No mask for the cook because ""she will feel bad otherwise"". My husband is trying to convince them but to no avail, and MIL has a valid argument - she wouldn't be able to do all the housework on her own. My parents (in another city) are contemplating getting back domestic help too - both have hypertension.

There is no way to convince them to adjust for the next 6-9 months, to have a simpler diet or use a vacuum cleaner or anything. I've tried it all and now I'm feeling very frustrated. Personally I also don't think anyone is shielding any more in India, when we have 2 million cases and adding 50K every day. I also worry that not taking the help of cooks and cleaners will result in additional workload for my husband and me and impact our respective job performance.

I thought about going back to my hometown to visit him since he might not have much longer but I wasn't sure if that is a good idea since he did test positive. I'm hoping I'm overreacting.

He is: mid 50s, diabetic, works 16 hour shifts overnight. **Please send some positive news my way** as I know he is in a dire situation.

For some backstory: I am 21 years old, and I've been dating my girlfriend for 5 years. My dad has always loved her. I was going to propose right after I graduated from university 2020/2021.

Every single family dinner my dad would always ask where my girlfriend was because she is such a joy to eat with and she has that magical ability that can improve someone's mood instantaneously.

She has traveled with my family to the beach and both our families met this past Thanksgiving. The point is, my family loves her to death and she loves my family.

Every time I think of my dad in the ICU all I picture is my whole family at the wedding, with the exception of my father.

It kills me every single time....

Do you know that feeling when you're heart broken? It is a hard feeling to describe for those who don't know what it feels like. Being heartbroken is like having something pulled out from your very being. It's like someone is yanking on the strings of your heart and you feel this sharp pain like something is missing but you're at a lost for what it is. It's like eating a McDonalds happy meal but there is nothing happy about it, in fact it is the worst meal you could ever have.

The sad part is, while I'm wishing for the best, I know that the worst is just right around the corner staring me down while I can only pray and hope that he survives through this.

\*sorry if story is patchy, I really need some support right now and I'm really fragmented\*

TLDR: Dad is super sick, I get sad whenever I think about him.

&#x200B;

EDIT: \*\*UPDATE\*\* My dad was signed on for trial medications last night and he received his first dose. This morning he was extubated but still extremely weak. He is currently recuperating according to the nurse, so hopefully things progress and he recovers swiftly and quickly.

I need some support Both my mother and younger brother have contracted Covid, both having positive tests and a source we can trace their cases back to (a friend of our mother's who was asymptomatic). Because of my insomnia, I avoided exposure to the two of them during the day and have had no symptoms the entire time before and now during their official quarantine windows (we obviously haven't been going out)   


The last few days have been increasingly stressful for me. I already deal with a number of mental health issues around anxiety and depression and suddenly having to worry about the well-being of my family members as well as watching out for my own safety has taken quiet a toll on me.

I understand we've been very lucky to have had 6 months of safety at home, but I'm so scared of her going back.

we live in dc and the cases are rising here again. there's talk of walking back the reopenig due to that, like California has. her office is huge, almost 1400 ppl at full capacity, i just don't know how they can plan to be able to cram 1400 people into one office building in less than 2 months when cases are still going up and basically nothing has changed since they started wfh in march.

Not to mention we rely on metro transport and it's nowhere near back to normal, i don't know how they even expect ppl to get to the office that don't drive, which is lots of ppl in this area. It all feels so scary and impossible and risky af and I've been on the verge of a panic attack all day.

2530,"Best friend chooses to take a risk with someones life. Friendship ender or am I overreacting? I’ll start at the beginning. About a month ago, my best friend (lets call him Thomas) tells me he thinks his wife has Covid-19. She’s exhibited two of the major symptoms of the virus - sustained shortness of breath and a fever for multiple days in a row. The shortness of breath was so bad she could barely utter a word. I agreed she most likely had Covid-19 based on the symptoms. (She has no prior history of asthma, or anything which could have been a previous symptom of shortness of breath). I said his wife should stay isolated in a separate room in the house, with no contact from the otherwise healthy family members. Thomas has three children, so he was taking care of the kids, doing all the housework, schooling, working from home and taking care of his wife, cleaning, sanitizing, plus making all the food, etc… Definitely a lot to handle for one person considering we have to shelter in place, but it’s what had to be done.

They called her doctor to let them know about what was going on and were advised to stay home unless it became more serious. This is what they did, except for one outing she did by herself. She wanted to get a test to see if it was Covid-19 and made an appointment on Day 3. She drove down to the testing center, only to be turned away after additional screening because she hadn’t had contact with anyone who had tested positive. At least not that she knew of anyway. She drove home to continue her self-isolation. Her symptoms continued for a total of five days before starting to get better. Her breathing became much better and the fever subsided. I was happy for her, that she was feeling better, but not out of the woods by any means.

In the middle of this, two days into his wife’s symptoms bing better, Thomas told me he was going to leave the house to meet a client. I was quite shocked by this. I explained your wife is presumed to have Covid-19 and it’s only been a couple days. You have a moral obligation to stay home and isolate for at least two weeks. He said work was light and he was worried about not being able to provide for his family. (His family is not near running out of money by any means.) I said there are bigger issues at stake here. His wife most likely has it and he could be asymptomatic. It’s not a chance to take lightly, especially with someone else life. He could unknowingly infect his client, as well as their family. He started crying on the phone, caught between a rock and a hard place. He said he was going to take every precaution, stay six feet away, wear a mask and gloves. I told him there was no guarantee he could be 100% safe. Since his wife was presumed positive, he should isolate as well. He didn’t want to hear anymore about it, so we had to end the conversation.

We didn’t speak again until two weeks after his client meeting. I couldn’t bring myself to even speak to him during that time. I view this as a moral issue, potentially putting someones life at risk and possibly killing them or causing them health issues. When we finally did speak on the phone, we got into it heavy and hard. It was the worst conversation we have ever had. Words were said and no side budged. He saw this as me not trusting his judgement, not supporting his best friend. I saw this as a moral issue with potential life changing decisions. I mean, I never ever expected this kind of behavior from him. After things got heated, we hung up. We went back and forth via text for the few days. He ended up wanting to get the last word (after continuing to try and get me to agree he did the right thing), and then said let’s agree to disagree. Not the oue I really wanted.

Am I wrong to be thinking this way? Am I being too hard on him? Should I have been more understanding or trusting? I’m not sure I can, or want to, move past this. This is supposedly my best friend. I hold him to a much higher standard than other people. Hell, I think it’s a basic standard I would hold anyone to. Lets keep each other safe. I never thought in a million years I’d be debating with him why it’s important to not take risks/chances with someone else life. That you can’t be 100% certain of safety. Is this, or should this be, a dealbreaker? He was my best friend, I’m just not to certain I know who this person is anymore.

2543,"A Tip That Calms Me Down Regarding Symptoms So, like most of you, I'm sure, I keep flipping out about potential symptoms. I have bad allergies and acid reflux (which had pretty much gone away previously, but stressing about this outbreak has brought it back). Both of which cause a lot of the symptoms of Covid19 (sore throat, chest pressure, a dry cough, etc.).

And then, of course, there's the panic disorder and OCD, which will let my body mimic basically all the symptoms.

But I read something recently that tends to calm me down, once I start fixating on potential symptoms. The minute i start getting a dry throat, or I cough a few times, or my face feels flushed, I worry that it's a medical emergency and I have to get help NOW. But the advice I found said to only go to a doctor if you would have gone to a doctor for the symptoms if there was no pandemic.  


So, a minor sore throat? Don't go. A cough a few times? Don't go. A super low-grade fever? Don't go. Trouble breathing, or an extremely high fever, or something like that? Call you doctor.  


Obviously, this advice doesn't mean ""go out and spread your germs"" or ""disregard something severe happening"". But in general, this has really helped soothe me. I'll gauge my symptoms by how I would have reacted to them prior to Covid19. Yes, all symptoms have ALWAYS stressed me out, but I never would have actually made an appointment for a dry throat before (especially if I have other tell-tale signs of an allergy attack, etc.).   


I hope this helps someone else too!

2544,"Individualism, Collectivism, Why Some Cultures Are Coping with COVID-19 Better Than Others, and How We Can Learn and Survive the Pandemic Had some time on my hands so I wrote this this morning. My psychology degree has a purpose! 


The middle of a pandemic is possibly not the best time to pull out cultural psychology texts, but an understanding of cultural values towards agency and adaptation may shed light on how people are coping (or not coping) with the current coronavirus situation, and how people can make things easier on themselves. 

It was in high school that I first learned about individualism versus collectivism, yet it is still very relevant, and continues to be a topic of great significance even in university and beyond. Thousands of psychological and sociological studies have been done on individualism vs collectivism. It is arguably one of the best evidenced and fundamental theories of cultural psychology.

To put it in quick terms: America is the most individualist country in the world. China and Japan are close cousins for being some of the most collectivist. 

Individualist countries (and citizens) value individuality, personal agency and choice, and the power to shape your own life and reality. 

Collectivist countries on the other hand value the collective,munity wellbeing, even with significant self sacrifice, and place much less value on personal agency, and much more on adaptation to others and to reality. 

Neither type of culture is inherently better than the other. But one type is uniquely more suited to adapting to a worldwide pandemic, and that’s collectivism. 

Politics aside, learning values from cultures different from our own, and understanding that some of our turmoil and pain from lack of agency and freedom during this time (for a distinctively altruistic purpose) is not permanent nor necessarily untouchable, can help us all adapt quicker, and thereby get back to a normal life faster, with a lot less loss of life and less possibility ofpletely collapsing healthcare systems.

Individualist cultures have the hardest time with personal freedom and choice taken away from them. They would always rather have the freedom to make their own choices, and even see life as ridden with more opportunities to make choices than more collectivist cultures. Regardless of whether or not the consequences are better or worse, individualists much rather have the agency to choose themselves - even if it leads to bad consequences. 

This not only hints at why America is so divided on political issues like Medicare For All (one of the prevailing arguments against it is “but I want to be able to choose what kind of healthcare I get”), but why even small curves of freedom (aka, shutting down schools and extracurriculars), feel much more painful and impossible to individualist cultures than collective ones. Americans may find it not too hard to be ordered to stay indoors for a week, but by week 2 or 3, they’re much more likely to grow antsy and say “fuck it,” effectively breaking quarantine.

Collective ones are much morefortable with some choices and freedoms being taken away as long as it’s for the collective good. Wuhan was able to bepletely shut down not only because of the power of the government there but also because people understood and valued the greater group wellbeing despite personal liberties being more or less removedpletely. 

Whilst that’s an extreme case, and possibly mocked by Americans for being “like mindless sheep,” a little shifting of mindset to prioritizing collective health over individual choice may help people adapt, and also save lives. 

The extreme fundamental difference between individualist views on agency and choice versus collectivist views on them underlies the continued bemusement of Americans at concepts like arranged marriages (even though, interestingly enough, they statistically succeed more than chosen marriages), Asian parents choosing career paths for their children, and more. 

But in times of crisis we all have a little something to learn from each other. And if you’re willing to be more selfless than usual, for a much longer period of time than usual, for your local healthcare, for your local elderly and immunpromised population, I promise we will all collectively be better off. 

Another fascinating dimension of difference between individualist cultures and collectivist ones are their attitudes towards reality: or rather, whether their instinct is to change reality to mould to what they want, or to adapt their own attitudes and self to reality. 

The difference is startling. Studies have shown again and again that individualist cultures are far more ready to exert influence on their surroundings to change them to what they want them to be - and this includes other people (aka arguing with others, standing up, taking leadership roles). 

Alternately, collectivist cultures across the board are far more able and willing to adapt to surroundings and others to keep the peace - after all, when you value the collective peace and wellbeing over your own individual one, it is far easier to be willing to change your own mindset and behaviours rather than to change others. 

This dimension of difference also underlines why individualist countries might have a collectively harder time following social distancing and quarantine rules, especially for an extended period of time. It simply isn’t a natural instinct for them to adapt rather than to try and be proactive and act upon their newfound reality. 

Unfortunately, the virus does not care. For once we’re faced with something we can’t change or control, and we need to adapt or face the consequences. And whilst consequences can be as mild as you just needing to spend more time alone for a while, they can be as severe as healthcare system collapse and personal illness and death.

I’m already anticipating the gut reaction backlash against writing this in that Americans especially might jump on my back for trying to indoctrinate munist values” or whatever, or somehow insinuating that we all need to be like mindless robots now. But that isn’t the case, and your gut reaction backlash really underscores how unconscious and deeply entrenched these cultural differences around the world are. 

I’m not saying one type of culture is better than the other, nor am I saying Americans should now be collectivist (because that is never happening regardless). 

Your liberties and long held values are facing pressure and stress, and that’s understandable. You don’t need to turn into a fierce leftist to learn from other cultures in times of unprecedented crisis, especially because adaptation and valuing the collective, greater good inmunity health is going to help you and your loved ones too. It is painful to have deeply entrenched ways of life and values be upturned. But these are unprecedented times and there is no time to experiment - it is time to adapt and survive, or refuse to adapt and bear the consequences - and the consequences won’t just affect you. It will affect yourmunity. 

A few months or a year may feel like a lifetime in times of crisis. But in reality, it is a very short period of time in the grand scheme, and a time for resilience, adaptation, and altruism. When your character is being tested for the greater good, sometimes it hurts for a while.

&#x200B;

I'm really starting to struggle. And a lot of that strugglees from the actions of my loved ones.  These are people that had taken the lockdown very seriously and minimizing their contact with others.  But in the last few weeks it's as if they've all suddenly changed their minds.  Just yesterday I received a picture from my mother-in-law of her new haircut she just got.  I also find out that my brother-in-law (who is immunpromised!) has been getting massages. My best friend has been going on camping trips with some of her friends and having back yard parties at their houses. She was also talking about going to get a haircut.

&#x200B;

And here I am avoiding all contact with people.  Refusing to get a haircut that I desperately need because I'm so fearful of having any stranger touch me.  I cannot understand how they are suddenly ok with this.  We've began to see an uptick in cases in our state, things are not getting better, so why are they changing their behavior?

2551,"Interesting Dutch article about COVID-19: why you can't take the number of deaths and death rate at face value I  just came across this Dutch article explaining COVID-19's current death dnumbers but with reason and a rational approach, and not from the 'millions will die from this' approach the general media has. It explains why you can't take the numbers of deaths and death rates at face value. Though, I must admit, it does not account for how the disease can possibly overrun our healthcare systems worst-case scenario. 

I've translated it to English, but it's still a long read. Nevertheless, it sheds a really good light on the current numbers provides good arguments about why we aren't at the mercy of this virus.  
[ (The numbers mentioned for reference are based on those of the Netherlands, but can be applied to the West in general)  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Recent numbers say that at most, 1.4% of all COVID-19 patients die. Two third of those are over 70 years of age. But to see the impact of the epidemic, we must look beyond the mortality rate.**

While no one can predict how big the corona-epidemic will eventually turn out to be, a pandemic of a proportional size like this isn't unique. Theparison with the Spanish Flu, which caused 20 million deaths in 1918 and 1919, is too alarmist. Because it happened right after World War I, there being mass malnourishment from the war and the lack of antibiotics (to treat secondary infections), it's something from another age.

But more recently, in the 1968-1969 period, the Hong Kong Flu made its rounds around the world, where an estimated 1 million people died from. The outbreak had people worried and it made the headlines, butplete public shutdown and mass panic like what's going on now wasn't a thing.   
The reason is evident: the internet didn't exist yet. Both governments and the public were hardly conscious of the impact the epidemic had, and the estimation of total deaths was made much later. Life continued as normal everywhere, and therefore the epidemic had very little economic consequences.

**Case fatality rate**

According to the recent publication in Nature Medicine, COVID-19 has a Case Fatality Rate (CFR, the percentage of deaths vs. the total amount of infected people) of 1.4%. With those numbers, the illness sits between Spanish Flu (estimation: 2,5% CFR) and the Hong Kong Flu (estimation: 0,5%). That doesn't mean 1,4% of all infected die: current estimations say at least half of infected people do not notice any symptoms, and therefore don't know they are carrying it.

*\*Insert Graphic here\**

The number of deaths in Wuhan per percentage of all diagnosed cases, indexed by age group. People under 40 years of age barely have any risk of dying from COVID-19. The small bump in people younger than 20 years doesn't matter much, given almost no one within that age group gets sick. The three colors all indicate a separate estimation of the CFR solely in people who get infected and experience symptoms.

On the one hand, that's good news, because the virus is less dangerous than it seems. The bad news is that carriers (so-called superspreaders) can spread the virus too, which makes fighting the epidemic harder. That's likely the crucial difference between past outbreaks of previous novel coronaviruses, namely SARS in 2003 (774 deaths, CFR 10%) and MERS in 2013 (800 deaths, CFR 35%). Those outbreaks were quickly contained because only people who got sick could spread those viruses.

If there are 'invisible' spreaders of the virus, then all social life must be reduced to contain the outbreak, like in China, and now too in the Netherlands/world for the most part. According to the article (in Nature Medicine), it does work: the chance of an infected person infecting a healthy individual halved. When the article was written, it wasn't known yet how successful these containment measures were. Now China has reported very few new cases over the last week. 

**Fixation on number of deaths**

With such epidemics, the focus is mainly on the number of deaths. All around the world, COVID-19 deaths are getting tallied and new records are met with horror. And that's weird actually because for other public health issues the loss of years of life are taken in consideration (or years of life remaining corrected by overall health, so-called Qaly's or Daly's)

Because of the fact that COVID-19 mainly affects the elderly and people who haveorbidities, the loss of years of life remaining during this epidemic is relatively limited. Data of COVID-19 deaths indexed per age group,bined with life expectancy indexed per age group in the Netherlands, a rough estimation was made: an individual COVID-19 death loses an average of 17 years of life remaining, based on China's numbers. Based on South-Korean numbers, which are likely more accurate, one loses 15 years of life to COVID-19. (These numbers are not entirely statistically applicable to the West since the median age of the Chinese and South-Korean populations are not exactly the same to those of the West. (my note: it's explained a bit awkwardly, but in layman's terms, if you die from COVID-19 you had an average of 15 years left to live if you didn't get COVID-19)

Compared to Ebola or SARS, which generally affect all age groups equally, the average loss of years of life remaining is between 30 and 40 years. AIDS is even worse because infected mothers can spread it to their newborns, meaning an average loss of 50 years of life remaining. If COVID-19 were to affect all age groups equally, it would lead to an average loss of 40 years of life remaining.  

A loss of 15 years of life remaining is the upper limit by the way because it assumes that people who die from COVID-19 are all equally healthy. And this is certainly not the case, as most deaths are in people who already had underlying health conditions. Mainly obesity seems to be a risk factor because it corresponds with high blood pressure, diabetes and the body being more out of shape. These people have worse life expectancies than the average person in their age group. 

**Worst-case scenario**

In the worst-case scenario, where 60% of the Dutch people will get infected and half of those get sick, 0,014 x 0,3 x 17.000.000 = 70.000 people will die from COVID-19 in the Netherlands. That sounds like a nightmare, a nightmare the Netherlands hasn't seen since WWII. 

Yet, that's wrong. In the Netherlands, 150.000 people die each year to what are considered 'natural causes', namely a variety of diseases. The spread of these deaths over the age groups is relatively identical to the numbers of COVID-19; most already had underlying conditions for years, 75% is over 65 years old and 25% is older than 80 years. 

So if the epidemicpletely goes out of control, it will cause an increase of about 50% of natural deaths in 2020. Then the epidemic has run most of its course. The rest of the populace will be younger and healthier so that the rate of natural deaths will be lower in the following years. After 5 years theposition of the population is almost back to normal as if the epidemic never happened.   

**Public Impact**

The current death rate of COVID-19 is not even close to these numbers. In Hubei, China, with a population of 60 million people, the epidemic seems to be over. The number has been stuck at 81.000 people infected and 3200 deaths. This sad record has since been broken by Northern-Italy, with 41.000 infected people and 3400 deaths.  

The numbers sound dramatic, but they are far fewer whenpared to the winterly peak in natural deaths that happens every year. In the Netherlands, this peak means around 10.000 extra deaths. In Northern Italy, which has roughly the same amount of people as the Netherlands, this shouldn't be that different. So even the worst-hit region in Europe, COVID-19 is a cause of death at the same rate as other natural causes of death. 

This reasoninges across as cynical because it ignores the personal suffering of all people who have lost loved ones to these natural causes. It's purely to see the public impact of this epidemic in a reasonable way. Because there are no winners with mass panic. Private sorrow is sad, but just to look at the current number of deaths is too shortsighted.    

An epidemic that randomly picks and kills people (like Ebola or SARS) or sometimes even picks out adults in their prime (AIDS) has a bigger impact on a social, economic and emotional scale,pared to flu-like epidemics who mainly affect the immunpromised and the elderly.  It's more rational to see this epidemic as a temporary increase in the 'death of natural causes' numbers that is happening all the time. Of course, this article is not a plea against fighting the epidemic, after all, we try to fight the other natural causes of death all the time as well.",60,0.91,foi5de,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/foi5de/interesting_dutch_article_about_covid19_why_you/,12,NA,2020-03-25,-82,586,-0.13993174061433447

2554,"More and More People Are Advocating Permanent Online School and It's Scaring Me I've seen more people (in increasing numbers) advocating the permanent digitalization. They say that schools are hubs of germs (germs correlating to largely benign illnesses, but they ignore that fact) so kids shouldn't be trusted to be in the same building together.

But I need school. All my neighbors are old men with no kids, so I can't rely on mymunity for socialization. I swim at my local YMCA every Wednesday (before the pandemic hit and I started socially distancing) where most of the kids there are noticabely younger than me. (I'm 13.)

Most of all, though, school has repeatedly saved my life. You wanna hear a story? My area is very conservative. I'm already an ethnic minority (Jewish) and I get enough crap for that. But even more crushingly, I have to hide who I am. [I'm gay and possibly transgender, but if I was open about my identity]( I'd probably be murdered.

When I go to school, I see girls wearing all the clothes I want to, and simply seeing them isforting. It reminds me of who I am and it just feels good to see them. It's just so reassuring.

Now, I have signed up for online schooling this semester, as I don't want to spread COVID-19. Once I get my vaccine, [which will probably be in a month or so]( I will return to school, because I need to. However, the amount of people saying schools should be permanent is scaring me.

It sounds so petty but I need to see girls to not kill myself. It's the one reassurance in my life of gender and sexual repression. If school was made permanently digital I'd probably kill myself; I need to see my friends, I need to see girls, it's crucial to my mental health.

My loving bf used to be the confident and optimistic sort of guy but recently due to the pandemic, he's been so sad and depressed. He's from the US and been freelancing as a writer and a front end developer but apparently he's been having such a difficult time finding remote jobs online. And this has started to take a toll on his mental health and self-esteem. 

He's started apologizing for not being good enough for me. He's be distant as he spends most of his time scouring the internet for work and sending applications. He cried to me last night because he never wanted to ask, but he needed money for rent and he was just at his wits' end how to manage his finances without a job. His mom died from cancer years ago and he's estranged from his relatives so he had no one to run to but me.

I still have a job so I could help a bit with money but I want to help in other ways. I've been looking for jobs for him, too. But we're from different countries so it's hard. And I might have been unknowingly insensitive when I told him before that he should be fine because I thought ITputer jobs are everywhere. I wish I had known better. :(

I don't know how to support the very person who's been my rock all this time. I feel so powerless. How are you supporting your SOs/loved ones in these trying times especially if they're unemployed and...drowning financially? Any tips where I could find more job postings on (junior) front end stuff in the US (for those of you living there)?

I realized that hyperanalyzing, reading countless articles and aggressively tracking the virus is literally killing me, and making me sicker than any virus could. Im a mentally unwell person already, but I'm working on my health. And I realized I shouldnt be fucking torturing myself with fearmongering articles and media coverage. I deserve to have peace of mind.

I'm taking solace in the fact that confirmed cases....kinda dont mean anything. If 80% of people experience low/no symptoms, and we didnt close borders with China until *after* reports started picking up, theres probably a good chance it's spread all over now. Who's to say we havent all been exposed?

A couple weeks ago, my grandma had a cough, fever, and was very lethargic and generally felt shitty. It took her about a week to recover, and then my grandpa's caught the same thing, two weeks later, except his wasnt as bad. Neither of them went to the doctor for it. Who's to say it was just a seasonal thing? It wasnt the flu. They could have very well been exposed to COVID at the same time, and my grandma had a shorter incubation period. We'd never know.

I'm taking solace in the fact that we've all likely been exposed, and also the fact that, even if we havent, I'm ramping up my hand washing, sanitizing, etc. I hardly ever go to crowded spaces and my city doesnt have public transportation.

There is one thing, though, that bothers me to no end. I read somewhere that COVID is staying in a person's system. That it can travel to the brain stem and just....stay there. And it causes permanent damage to some organs. And both of those things *terrify* me. Especially the first one. It's making my paranoid brain go crazy. What if theres a ""phase 2"" to the disease we dont know of yet? What if it kills your immune system, like HIV/AIDS? what if it lays dormant, then decides to blow up, like measles encephalitis?

I cant keep reading articles. I'll fall down the rabbit hole, and I dont want to feel helpless again. I want to sort out everything in my mind, sweep the fear and the destructive thoughts away and take this time to be productive, and just go about my day to day with a little more sanitizer and a LOT less worry.

Once the outside world doesn't exist, and it's just me and my mind alone, creating a world within these 4 walls...what's the point of life?

2604,"I Kissed My Boyfriend Today After not seeing him for weeks, now, I went to visit. I got a job recently where I am around people all the time. I wear a mask since I can't social distance at my job. I also sanitize as often as I can, wiping things down left and right and using hand sanitizer as though my soul depended on it. 

I was saying goodbye to him and he reached out to me for an air hug. I broke down. I hugged him and kissed him goodbye because it will be a long time before I see him again. 

Even though I still wear a mask everywhere I go, mymunity has decided to stop social distancing (not that they ever started tbh). I've given up on being the only person I know to social distance. I've given up on sacrificing my relationships and mental health when everyone else is just doing whatever they want and have been for months. 

I have spent the last two monthspletely secluded from my loved ones and only going out for food and work. I finally broke. 

I'm moving in with him as soon as I can. I know I shouldn't have had physical contact with him like I did, but I'm only human and I miss those closest to me so much. 

I do live with my grandmother, who has been telling me to keep my relationship with my boyfriend alive by being with him. I've been trying to protect her by isolating like I have. She's not upset with me and she's glad I did, but I still know I shouldn't have. She says it's not fair for me to be the only one sacrificing the things I love.

I plan topletely isolate, should I get sick, by moving in with my boyfriend for the duration if the symptoms. I have also been tested for Covid and plan to be tested as often as I can be when the testinges to town. Even if I don't feel sick, I think it's a good thing to do. It helps organizations gather data, too. 

Anyway, this has been a super hard time for all of us. I've really struggled with depression, probably the hardest I ever have. My boyfriend has also struggled a lot during our separation. Being away from everyone I love isn't normal... It's not healthy mentally... And I feel that. 

I hope you're all holding up well. I hope you're all steady mentally and financially. I hope you all have plentiful food and support. I hope you're well and unafraid.",52,0.86,gu9ha0,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gu9ha0/i_kissed_my_boyfriend_today/,15,Support,2020-06-01,0,115,0
2605,"Exposure therapy for integrating back into themunity Hey all! I came across this page by accident and I’m glad I did. I spent a while reading different posts (ranging from people who feel like they don’t have a desire to go out again, to those who are running out the doors once we are COVID-19 free).  As an Occupational therapist, I work with a lot of people with anxiety. Onemon thing a lot of my clients have been telling me is how their mood has improved since COVID-19 has begun.  That’s almost theplete opposite from what people in my everyday life would report. When I ask them why they feel better, they begin to tell me it’s because they are no longer being forced to get back out there and engage with others/run errands/attend appointments in person.

While COVID-19 may feel like a vacation to some (or a death sentence to others), I would suggest developing habits to ensure you have an easy transition when things go back to “normal”.  I know a lot of us believe that “normal” will not look like what it did before, but there will still be some expectation to leave the home once in a while.  I genuinely feel worried that people will fall deeper and deeper into the idea that home is safety and the world is a dangerous place.

If you are finding yourself being more fearful of the world each passing day, I encourage you to take small steps when getting back out there. With any goal, make sure it’s SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time sensitive). So instead of making a goal that I will go out more, try to make a more specific one like:
1) I will sit on my porch Monday afternoon for 10 minutes
2) I will drive to the Walmart parking lot across the street, and sit in my car while I people watch for 10 minutes

None of what I’m saying is exactly earth shattering. But by making SMART goals and exposing yourself to themunity in small steps, you’ll find the transition back into society a bit more manageable each day. 

Just thought I’d share my 2 cents.

2607,"How to survive quarantine/social distancing: by someone who's been isolated their whole life! EDIT: Very few people seem to be getting the message. So I invite you to please read this through and if you get angry, hurt, or otherwise offended by my OP, then stop reading, don't immediately reply, and click this link instead: [

Hi, everyone! How are you?

I'd like to help at least some people out with withstanding quarantine. I've been noticing a lot more memes, posts,ments, and videos online which are focusing on the fact that a lot of people feel like they're being driven insane from the social distancing and quarantining.

I mean, anyone would! Being isolated in any way is difficult for any reason. Even without COVID-19ing into the picture, it's damn hard to go for prolonged periods of time without the social contact which so many people crave.

Luckily though, I have been isolated (relatively speaking) my whole life; and especially within the past 2 years after having met my fiance, I have largely spent my life in self-isolation. I do my work and school at home, and I've only actually stepped outside maybe a third of the length of time between the start of our relationship and now... most of that was within the first year.

So in all honesty, when I started hearing about COVID-19, the idea that we'd be stuck indoors for the foreseeable future was not any change of pace for me, personally. It's something I've spent my whole life having to adapt to, but which now I fully embrace.

Unfortunately, a lot of the world doesn't have the luxury of experience, or the knowledge of how to survive while socially isolated. So, here are my tips and guidelines on surviving your social isolation/quarantine experience!

Here's what not to do.

1. **DON'T be unhealthy!** Again, this is something I've had trouble with. Rewarding yourself for 10 minutes on a treadmill - even an imaginary treadmill - by ordering Chipotle from Postmates is NOT the same as being healthy. Don't order as much fast food if you can help it. Home-cooked meals are always tastier, healthier, and more fun to make, too.
2. **DON'T be lazy!** Don't use excuses to justify your laziness. If you're telling yourself you can't learn, or you can't be active, or you can't wash your clothes and do the dishes despite being stuck inside all day because you're browsing reddit while having The Clone Wars Season 7 streaming in the background, then you're being a lazy dumbass. Turn off the TV, put down the phone, shut down yourputer. Look around you. Look at yourself. What needs to be done? Do it.
3. **DON'T be selfish!** We're all in this thing together. Don't take more than you need in this time: food or water; time alone; breaks; entertainment; etc. Instead, use the time you have to use what you've got to put yourself at a point where you're at the very least stable, and then help others do the same. If and when you have excess, give it to someone who doesn't. If you've got extra cash, food, or clothes, give it to charity. Lots of people need that stuff during the pandemic, and lots more will need it after. If you've got excess time,fort someone who needs it. Or teach someone who wants to learn a skill which you have. Just don't be selfish by keeping more than what you need.

Here's what to do!

1. **Stay active!** I myself need a lot of help with this, but staying active indoors is a big thing. A little bit of space goes a long way. So instead of using that part of the house where you usually pace as a spot of worrying and stress, turn it into a space where you don't have to do anything different, physically; but where your mental attitude affects whether or not this pacing is healthy. Because, yes, exercising while stressed does help relieve the stress, but if you're just pacing while focusing on your stress, then it doesn't help a whole lot. So if you can, maybe try doing some short-distant sprinting instead of pacing. Maybebine it with squats, or lunges. Jumping jacks help. So do push-ups and crunches. A lot of Americans might be reading this and thinking, ""Wait, like PE we used to do in school?"" Yes, like PE. You were taught those basic exercises as a kid for a reason.
2. **Stay smart!** So, we're pretty much stuck indoors for who-knows-how-long. School may or may not be in session for a lot of us. If you're in high school or equivalent, I'm sure you might be attending your classes online. If you're a college/university student, I can see that ""might"" turning into a big ""maybe sometimes"" for a lot of you, haha. A lot of people aren't even in school, and haven't been for a while. And yeah, most of us don't like school, or are workers now. But that doesn't mean we have to distance ourselves from learning. So, take the time to learn, whether it be a formal class or not.

* How do you do this? There's a few different ways. Practically speaking, you're gonna want to start teaching yourself any basic skills you've been lacking in life. Not just cooking and cleaning, but also things like plumbing, repair, and basic machinery.
* More abstractly, you can teach yourself any other field you might find interesting. In my experience, school always sucked because it spent so many years forcing me into classes which were not taught effectively, until I was eventually told ""Now pick ONE of those subjects to focus on FOREVER or else YOU WILL BE POOR!"" Not fun. And I'm sure for a lot of you, it's the same way. But now, you have the freedom of the Internet to teach yourself the subjects YOU want to learn, at YOUR pace, with YOUR own way of practicing these skills at home. And you also have people online who have the time now to critique and help you succeed, just as you do too. So learn and teach, everyone!

1. **Look forward, backward, inside, and out!** This is a period where I think a lot of us feel like time is sort of wonky. So we might feel anxious about the present moment, and about the past, and the future, all at the same time; and at a much more intense level than we otherwise would be! But why? In my experience, it's because I never quite dedicated any time to think about my own life, and eventually had enough time on my hands that thinking about it was something I knew at some point I'd have to face. And that the refusal to face it, was what was causing my anxieties. So what I rmend you do is take some of the excess time you have each day to just sit down and... think.

* Look **forward**; plan out the goals and future you would like to aplish. Not only once the threat of COVID-19 ends, but also while in isolation. Also plan out the steps you'll take to get there, and each part of those steps. Once you have a plan, start taking action. And remember that even if one step can't be done the way you planned, you can always change it to be more flexible while still working toward your goal.
* Look **backward**; reflect on your life choices. Ask yourself ufortable questions. We all know that the AITA subreddit is a place of external validation. But so is asking your family and friends if you've ever been the asshole of a given situation. Of course they'll usually say no. But if you ask yourself that. With the benefit of hindsight, put yourself in a ""fly on the wall"" mindset of past events where you might have been the asshole. Even if it was just to yourself. As painful as it is to admit, yes, we've all been assholes. So admit that you've been an asshole. BUT don't use it to pity or self-loathe. Examine why and how you were the asshole, and then going forward, avoid the mindset or circumstances that made you an asshole in the past.
* Look **inside**; Ask yourself who YOU are. What are your values? What are your morals? Can you make a list of values you hold dear? Or how you learned them and practice them? Do you use those values in a hypocritical way, by using them only when they benefit yourself? Or do you actively try and advance those same values for other people too? Yes, ***even and especially*** if it's going out of your way. Can you sum up your values into a single word? Can you sum up your moral code (how you live by those values for yourself and so that others can too) in three sentences? Don't stop thinking about this each day until you can. Also ask yourself if anything you're doing in your daily life causes you anxieties. Take this time to grow.
* Look **out**; Look around you. Take time to appreciate the life you do have. You have a roof over your head, food in the pantry, and clothes to wear. That's more than a lot of people could ever afford. Never mind anything else you've got. Appreciate how you got to where you are right now. It might not seem like heaven, but at least it isn't hell. So look around you at the world you know, and the things you have, and ask yourself questions like: Do I appreciate everything I have? Is this thing I have actually worth keeping, or would it be better elsewhere? Who helped me get the things I have? Who taught me important lessons which I can remind myself of with the stuff I have? And, don't be afraid to ""look out"" in the moremon way. Look out for any potential dangers to your mental and physical health you're being exposed to, and try your best to fix the situations.

\---

Some people might be reading this and thinking, ""Whoa, look at this guy! He's using COVID-19 as a soapbox to tell us how to live our lives! You think you're so moral, buddy? Well FUCK YOU!"" If you're one of those people, I can't stop you from thinking that. And I wouldn't want to force you to change your mindset. Take it or leave it, it's your call.

Other people might read this and just ""get it"". Congratulations!

And some other people - I think maybe the majority of people - who read this are sort of in the middle. You might be confused as to how or why this weird post which talks about morality so much helps anyone with dealing with COVID-19. But a part of you thinks it does.

Well, if you're in that group, then I'll explain it to you. Does this post help with COVID-19? No. I never said it does! It's supposed to help you deal with the isolation we're all going through so you don't go insane.  And once COVID-19 is over and done with, then if you've taken this post to heart, you can keep using the skills you've learned and practiced to help others in their own situations - whether because of social isolation or not.

If you'd asked me a few years ago to read this post and answer the question, ""how can this help you, right now?"" Then I, as someone who was maybe between 19-21, wouldn't have been able to answer. But by learning to use my isolation to learn about myself, I learned to enjoy it. And from there, I learned to help other people. And from there, I learned how to enjoy life as much as I can, whether I'm by myself or with others.

And I hope that everyone who reads this, and who normally spends their time with others, and not enough time with themselves, uses this post to guide them. We're in a spot in life where a lot of us are just spending so much time by ourselves, indoors. Lots of people are feeling cooped-up because now they have to spend more time alone than otherwise.

Don't run away from the alone time. Embrace it. Learn about yourself. And then, when you CAN spend time with others, use this time you'd spent learning how to be a better person to make the enjoyment of life more fun for everyone involved.

2608,"Dad on vent for over two weeks, just got a scary phone call from the hospital My dad started showing covid-19 symptoms on March 12, was admitted to the hospital on March 19, and was intubated and put on a vent on March 23. They told us when they intubated him that it wasn't an emergency but just precautionary to help him bc his breathing was a little labored, so they wanted his body to rest while his lungs got stronger. He got the positive test result on March 21, I believe. That day was also the last day I spoke with him over FaceTime. They are now trying to wean him off the vent but today they called my mom and told her that he's just not responding well toing off the vent and that we should prepare for the worst. I can't believe I just typed those words. They're going to try again but we don't know how many times. 

I don't know what to do, I'm separated from my mom and siblings right now and I don't know whether I should go home to be with them or stay away. Apparently he did better on Monday when they played his favorite music but for some reason they can't play music anymore? But they said we could bring a radio or something so my mom is going to try to do that. 

I just can't believe this is happening. My dad is in his late 60s and has an underlying lung condition, but he was so healthy and vibrant even after he started feeling sick. This isn't supposed to happen. And we can't even go be with him.

2609,"Mom is dying and I feel hopeless. Hello, I don't know why I'm posting.  Part of me hopes that by venting I'll somehow be magically better and all this will go away.


Mom is a registered nurse.  For the last 15 years she served women in labor and delivery, high risk antepartum and women's health clinics.  She was my inspiration to go back to school and be a nurse myself.  I have been one for 13 years now.


Last week it was a mild fever, today she is intubated and fighting for her life.  Yesterday the ICU doc called me to ask if I still wanted her to have CPR.  He did not think it would help her if it came to it.  We took the calculated risk to transfer her to Hopkins, covid central her in MD.  He wasn't sure she was strong enough to make it there, but she did.  That's my mom!


She is retired but took a few shifts at a women's health clinic to make ends meet and help those women who spoke only Spanish.  She was barely strong enough for those 3 days a week, but she did it because she loved her patients.


I'm angry.  I want to blame her work.  They were/are still seeing patients.  One of there docs may have been sick, but I will never know the truth.  They wouldn't give out n95 masks to the nurses cause they weren't high risk.


I'm scared.  Not just that she may die.  I'm scared of interacting with people who selfishly lie about their symptoms to get non emergency things.  Some asshole who wanted her pap smear done right now may have lied to keep her appointment.  I hope it was worth my mom's health.  


I'm scared of my docs.  Afraid they may be doing the same.  Scheduling non emergent patient care and calling it urgent  to force it through the hospital doors.  


I'm scared of myself.  Scared that this is going to take away my ability to trust.  Steal my empathy andpassion.  Scared I would hesitate to do whats needed because of this.


I don't know whether this is helpful.  I don't know if I'm a broken nurse.  I just know I'm scared.

2614,"I spend the first 19 years of my life in the closet, hating myself. I finally came out last year and was really looking forward to dating and living life, and this happens. I'm lonely. And today health authorities warned about health systems being in danger of collapsing I'm gay, my parents were very religious and homophobic. They forced me to go to a christian highschool where teachers taught being gay was not only a sin, but either a depraved choice or result of mental illness. I'm now in a progressive college and my friends are all either LGBT themselves, or allies. But I still had to deal with internalized self-hatred and homophobia. It took me two years of college toe out. That was around the middle of last year, and it went great, my parents came to terms with it and my friends didn't care (in a good way). 

I still needed to take it slow with dating because of myplete lack of experience. The most I did last year was kiss random strangers at bars (this included my first kiss). Nothing close to serious. And don't get me wrong, it was fun and I miss it, but it is not what I truly want. I want a relationship, someone to hold hands with, cook dinner for, plan cute elaborate dates... I've never had that. I'm not perfect but I feel like I'd be a good partner.

But I wasn't ready last year. I needed to go to therapy, and I did. I worked on myself for months untill I felt I was ready to start dating. And then we had our first confirmed case of covid. My country's situation was looking good but cases have spiked and it's worsening. Authorities are now worried about health systems collapsing like in other places. Obviously staying safe is the priority so it seems like I won't be able to date for at least a year, maybe more. And I'm having a hard time dealing with that. I had already waited so long, and now not only do I have to wait longer, but feel even lonelier since I can't even see my friends or go clubbing. I miss physical contact.

And I'm seeing people who I matched with back in march, who I had good connections with, getting into relationships recently. This after I declined meeting in person and texting slowed down. I feel like I'm missing good chances at finding a partner because of this. I've considered virtual dating, but I already don't know how to date normally, and now I can't really on my friends' advice because none of them have experience dating during a pandemic (shocking, I know /s). Btw, if any of you have been dating while staying safe, I'd be grateful to hear about your experiences.

And I know this is a small problem to have considering the circumstances, which makes me feel even more shitty forplaining. But man, I'm lonely.

2615,"COVID-19 has made dating impossible, and I miss physical contact. 32M living in a major city. I was off dating apps for awhile to focus more on myself, and I literally got back on Bumble and Tinder about a week before the pandemic started to shut everything down in the United States. I felt confident, I felt good, and I felt ready to get back out there in the sometimes unforgiving dating world, and just like that the rug was swept under me, and everything just ground to a halt. 

Dating is impossible, and it's been months since I have had any emotionally fulfilling physical contact. I'm sick of doing virtual dates, I'm sick of doing socially distant walks in the park, I'm sick of watching porn and I don't even give a shit about sexting. I want to touch. I want to feel someone's body close to mine. I want to feel their warmth, and their body heat mix with mine. I'm incredibly sexually frustrated and horny, but at this point I'll be happy with simply cuddling while watching a good movie. 

Even the dating profiles have gotten worse since the lockdown. So many profiles say things like ""I'm only on here because I'm bored, entertain me."" I'm not here for anyone's entertainment; I'm there to find an actual relationship, and I feel like I'm expendable, and like I'm some court jester. I want to meet people through my hobbies and meetups in-person, but obviously that's not happening right now. 

For the most part I'm ok with being single and on my own. I have a lot of hobbies and interests that keep me busy like fitness, reading, playing tabletop games (solo games now,) self-teaching myself through online classes, and I'm lucky enough to work, but after being single for awhile I'm ready to get out there, and I'm so tired of this virus putting a stop to it.

2620,"We might have covid and I'm freaking out Hi,

  


Like I mentioned, I have the feeling I and my wife have contracted covid. I do not know what to do and am kind of freaking out. I'm trying to not think about it but am unable to do so. I have followed protocol as best I could, masks, hand sanitizer, hand washes etc. yet here I am.

  


Let me start with what I feel right now. I feel like I have a cold with no runny nose but a very dry nasal passage/throat. I have a fever which when doing routine things like walking around isn't showing, but the moment I get in bed/couch or put aforter on me, I can feel the heat. Still no cough, but I feel something very strange in my throat, like something is in there and I'm scared to try and cough. My wife has a non persistent cough but shares all the other things I mentioned.

  


All of my family stays in another country and currently we are the only two here in Florida. I am genuinely scared and have no idea what I'm doing. I'm trying to put on a brave face so I do not scare my wife but I'm freaking out.

  


I tried reading as much as I could online on what and how to take care of myself and my wife, but additional resources would be appreciated. But more than that, I needed a place to talk this out and be heard. Just felt that I needed some support and the first thing that came to mind was to get on Reddit.

\----

I bought a thermometer on Amazon and am waiting to get it so I can create a temperature log. I'm also maintaining a log of all medicines we are taking to control any fever or cough symptoms. Ideas and thoughts would be appreciated.

2621,"There’s a joke that goes something like, “What’s worse than a break-up? A pandemic. What’s worse than a pandemic? A break-up during a pandemic.” Currently it appears that my life is structured on enhancing this joke with extra punchlines. On Saturday I had a break-up of sorts and entered a major depressive episode. 


On Monday:

- My landlord illegally entered my home (I live alone) while I was out and invaded my privacy (quick pause here - my place looked like a tornado blasted through it due to my extreme depression, with personal objects lying around everywhere; needless to say I felt extremely embarrassed and violated) and berated me for being depressed.

- My relationship with my father fell apart.

- My “friends” who I would do anything for and have helped through rough times told me to deal with it on my own and have ignored me since.

- I went to the hospital in crisis threatening to hurt myself and I was sent home with an Ativan after a 5 minute interview with a doctor who was convinced I wasn’t a safety threat.

- My BetterHelp therapist, who I text-livestreamed this whole ordeal to, has ghosted me. 


On top of that, today after I called out my landlord on entering my home illegally, he, who I might add has constantly and blatantly sexually harassed me, threatened me with eviction for “being an ass” -- but falling under the excuse that “a family member wants to move in”.


I am at my wits’ end. I feel incredibly alone and hopeless. All attempts to reach out for professional help have been in vain and I am so discouraged. Now I must accept the fact that as soon as the pandemic eviction laws are lifted, I will likely either be evicted or be harassed enough to be forced into moving out.


I am a musician. As you can imagine my ie has beenpletely shattered by the pandemic. I have no promises for any uing gigs after the pandemic and I certainly cannot afford to move into another home by myself (I know - “Boohoo, cry me a river. Why not just have roommates?” The state of my mental health right now makes having roommates an unimaginable challenge, but it’s likely something I’ll have to face in order to have a home). 


Ba-dum, tss.

Edit: I am SO thankful for all the support. It's certainly been a hard time, I haven't been eating or sleeping, and I've added restraints on my door to help me feel safe. It looks like I can report this to the tenancy board of my province, but ultimately I'll have to move out.

2622,"Why I decided to leave the house again (Caution: reason is not uplifting) I have been in my flat for a week now, sitting here with my cat and my monthsworth of supplies. Yesterday evening I decided to go outside again today. The reason is, that I realised ""Nobody is stopping the spread of the virus"", I will simply get it eventuelly. It is kind of a sad reason, but I realised, that since my government remainspletly inactive for the most part and most people in my country are stupid enough, to believe the ""It´s just the flu""-bs, nothing will change until thousands of people fall sick. 

It´s also unrealistic for me to stay home until we have a vaccine (best case scenario for that is 6 months, worst case is 18 months) or even a medication. I will simply have to rely on the fact, that I´m still relativly young and mostly healthy.

The number of cases in my country (Germany) increases by about 40-60% every day, most people are beeing send home to self quarantine but it is not enforced in any way and from what I´ve heard, people are not taking it seriously.

One could say, I´m simply giving up on isolating myself. I suspect that we will be ordered to mass isolate in a couple of weeks, since not much is done to slow the spread. Since I do recall some things from math class, I know that, if the current increase of around 50% daily isn´t stopped, we will be looking at 100.000 infections at aroud the 19th of March. 

Until then, I decided to enjoy life again. I will still not shake hands and I will still avoid all crowded places as much as possible, use gloves for things like the atm etc, since I´m not crazy :)

I have been sitting at home for the last couple of days, informing myself and writing various government agencys in my country, aswell as my city. All answes I have gotten were somewhat dismissive.

There is simply nothing I can do, especially if nobody else is doing anything.

This week I cancelled a long-planned 12-day trip to Arizona for spring training, a family event, and then a trip to the Midwest to visit family.

Sure I go and pick up food whether it's actual groceries or take out, but even with places reopening I don't feel safe to go to anywhere else that I haven't already been doing.  


I feel like the more places I go to the more of a risk I have to COVID19 even with businesses following CDC guidelines. Infact a reason I don't go is because I just lost the enjoyment of going somewhere to have fun that doesn't have a huge list of regulations to follow. Also I think I am just used to the stay at home thing by now and gotten used to this routine of going to work,ing home, going to work,ing home, etc. that unless theye out with a vaccine I am not going anywhere that isn't essential.   


It's deadly due to the fact either you could die from it, or spread it to someone else who is weak to it and get them sick or killed.

2642,"I feel terrible and I have no friends to talk to Note: I am a high-school student, that's all the backstory I'm willing to give.

I didn't really have any problems the first \~4 months of quarantine (although I did notice the lack of my already limited social interaction did have a slight effect on me). I understood the risks and made sure to stay safe (and still do!), which meant minimal contact with people, limited going out... limited anything, mostly. I was okay with that. Being introverted meant I wasn't going to go crazy over no parties or anything, and I had plenty of games, movies, shows, hiking, even music to keep me occupied with. I also spent a lot of time reading and writing, which was a great positive in my eyes. I started losing weight and am still on a weight-loss journey, I increased family time, I just felt good. Yeah, the occasional corona news upset me, but it never genuinely lasted, and I kept on feeling good.

But I'm going to be honest here. Sometime during mid-July, things got to me. I don't know what triggered it exactly, but I started feeling worthless and unloved to an unhealthy degree. This is because, over the span of four and a half months, I had only really engaged in conversation with around 5 people I consider ""friends"", and calling all of them friends is a bit shaky. I realized how alone I truly am. Family is wonderful, but I can't just depend on them for all my social interaction, and I can't throw all my insecurities at their feet either. I am introverted, yes, but I still love hanging out with people and just talking about things (something I've done for years), and now I've realized nobody really wants to do that with me anymore, not even over text really.

I've never been the popular kid, but I've always had at least one to three close friends (hell I had three right before quarantine and we constantly hung out together) and a bunch of casual acquaintances. But now I feel I have nothing. Quarantine distanced those close three friends from me and most of my ""casual acquaintances"" haven't made the effort to say hello in six months. I feel like shit and to a certain degree I understand all of us are going through the same issues now, the same fears and worries... but man, I really just hate it. I don't feel like doing anything because I have no one to share what with the things I do, and I partially understand it's not just quarantine that's the root of the problem. I mean, close friends stay close friends through all adversity, right? So it can't just be quarantine issues that have made me friendless.

I don't know, it's just I've felt horrible these past two months and I don't feel like I have anyone to vent to about it. School in my country is delayed until October 1st, but I know just going back to school won't solve issues.

I've been slacking on doing everything, all I want to do is sleep or sit around instead of doing something like a workout. My diet is getting worse, some days I don't want to eat, other times I eat like I haven't eaten before. I've been feeling lonelier than ever, I've been facetiming and texting people, but the energy isn't there anymore. I can barely hold a conversation over text, and it's getting not as exciting over facetime. Maybe I'm just facetiming the same people?

2647,"week 4 of loss of smell, dry cough, muscle pain and headache, what should I do It has been 4 weeks since I became sick on 1 April. Originally I had sore throat, headache and muscle pain. Then the sore throat was gone but dry cough started. On the 6 April, I lost my sense of smellpletely. I live in the UK and I called NHS for help. After going through some questions, they suggested me to take paracetamol and stay at home. Because I never have fever since I'm ill, the doctor advised me to stay calm and these symptoms will be gone within 4 weeks automatically.

&#x200B;

I am very thankful for NHS and patiently isolated at home for these symptoms to go away even though I feel headache, muscle pain, cough and can't smell every day. Now it's been 4 weeks and these symptoms are still here. I called NHS this morning for help, telling them that I don't feel better and request to get tested. They refused me because there is no evidence that I need to be tested.

&#x200B;

Now I am freaking out not only because they refuse to let me get tested but also they have done nothing except keep telling to stay at home. I am suffering everyday, if I die tomorrow, I really want to know what I am dying for.

&#x200B;

Now blow are my questions and would be highly appreciated if anyone can help.

1. for these people who lost their sense of smell, how long does it take to get back to normal, is there anything to help getting the sense of smell back?

2648,"Don't feel guilty Maybe you're like me: I have had this creeping sensation that I'm probably already infected, but asymptomatic, and that I may have spread the virus unknowingly before I fully understood the situation. It's very possible. That's how this thing traveled so quickly.

You have to remember that the network of humans touching each other is simply the landscape for a virus. It's like it's spreading in a petri dish - we are all links in a chain that can only separate from each other with EXTREME effort. And to coordinate this among so many people is incredibly ambitious, andplicated. Because we exist in a network. This has very little to do with you, individually.

To clarify: you MUST do your part to break the chain of transmission, and I would guess that 99% of the people reading this are already quarantining to the highest degree they are able, given the very hard decisions people have to make regarding pay and social connections. We are all doing the best we can.

My point is just that if you are regretting a handshake from 3 weeks ago, you can forgive yourself. And if you do find out you were infected, that doesn't inherently mean you did anything wrong.

2677,"If a vaccine doesn't ultimately end all social distancing, what does? In the US for context.

I'm not a COVID denier in any way, shape, or form. I realize that information changes, and that much was and still is uncertain about this disease, the long term impacts, and how long immunity lasts. But lately I've been pretty exasperated with the shifting goalposts on what will actually end social distancing.  (By ""social distancing,"" I mean limits on crowds, quarantine periods upon arrival, not being able to go to a school or work setting without restriction, and the like. Mandatory mask wearing too I suppose, although that will probably just stick around for a while voluntarily, which is fine by me; I plan on wearing a mask when I'm sick or in bad flu seasons from now on.) In March, a lot of people got the idea that it would end with \~1-2 months lockdown. Maybe it could have been better by a lot if we had actual testing and quarantine plans, but I guess that wasn't meant to be. Then we started to hear ""no, we need some degree of social distancing until there's a vaccine, or very effective treatment, or the virus just burns itself out."" Ok, that's rough, but we can probably live with that, especially if said testing planse on line...eventually.

Now it's looking quite likely that there will be a vaccine, maybe starting wide distribution as early as late winter next year, but it's probably not going to be as effective as, say, the measles vaccine. With that understanding hase a flurry of interviews, headlines, and op-eds talking about how a vaccine won't end the crisis overnight (ok, we knew that) and that some forms of social distancing will remain necessary ""for the forseeable future."" And when people say the ""crisis will end"" as this article does ([ it's always couched in terms like, quoting Dr. Fauci, “by the time we get around through 2021, we can start having some form of normality. Maybe not exactly the way it was, but certainly different than what we’re doing right now.”

First of all, when is ""around through 2021?"" Is it this time in 2021 or on January 1, 2022? More importantly, does that mean that ""some form of normality"" is the best we'll ever get? Because that sure sounds a lot like...right now, at least in regions where cases are below 500/day. HOW does society continue to function if that's the case? It basically sounds like seeing people, gathering for religious services, education,munity gatherings, or just spending time, supporting people who need a leg up, travelling, having a sense of purpose beyond a desk andputer in your house or apartment that doesn't involve terror about capturing a novel coronavirus that could attack your heart and lungs for the rest of your life if you can't work from home are gone for good.

Some of it is caution, sure, and some of it is probably the media's love of alarmist headlines that drive doomscrolling. I've got no problems with wearing masks and being careful in order to keep people safe. And yes, one can expect some changes to stick around even in the best case, and that's probably good (more flexibility on sick time, more flexibility with working from home, symptom screening for visits at nursing homes and crossing international borders). But the more I hear claims like that, the more it seems like we're stuck in this cloistered life forever, or at least for about a decade or so. Heck, New Zealand tried to outright eliminate the virus by locking down untilmunity spread was gone; they did, and were basically able to reopen everything including huge soccer stadiums...and somehow, the virus came back, and the best they can do is ""level 2"" restrictions now.

For my part, permanent social distancing basically means what I want to do with my life is worthless, and I have to figure out a new career path which I won't be nearly aspetent at. I had a more speculative ""fallback"" option that for various reasons hasn't been active for a year and is even more in the toilet than my main goal, so that's not really an option either. Maybe I'm just a bad person for caring about that and wanting normality. Maybe that means I don't care about other people, though I certainly think I care. But I just don't see how society continues to function if this really is the new, permanent, normal.

So if we're not getting a 100% effective vaccine, and the virus isn't going to go away like SARS-CoV-1 did, is there ANY threshold that allows ALL social distancing to end at some point? Obviously nobody can predict when this would be likely to happen. And I'm not looking for a debate on the relative wisdom of different jurisdictions' current policies. I'm asking WHAT thresholds have to be met. Or are there none, and this is just life now?",43,0.95,inzaou,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/inzaou/if_a_vaccine_doesnt_ultimately_end_all_social/,27,Trigger Warning,2020-09-07,-7,260,-0.026923076923076925
2678,"Frustrated watching Covid be irresponsibly spread by my own selfish family We're in Florida, literal Covid hotspot of the world right now. My 2 cousins work with someone who was hospitalized for Covid this week. Apparently, he never wore a mask at work. He got it from his kids, he thinks. When he got his positive test back, they told him theres' ""no need to notify anybody, you're only contagious once you have a positive test"". We knew this but it basically confirms contact tracing in Florida is bullshit. 

Anyway, my cousins did not get tested. One of my cousins started feeling symptoms a few days later, said it was just his ""sinuses"". He decided to continue with his plans and go on vacation with his girlfriend anyway, somewhere else in Florida. The other cousin is going to California this week with friends. Refuses to get tested, says ""if I haven't caught it by now, i'm good"", she's not isolating, she's seeing people including her pregnant friend, and still traveling across the nation.

Here's the kicker. When my Mom and I try and talk them both into getting tested, and share the statistics of how bad cases are in Florida, they tell us to stop trying to scare them. They tell us we're watching too much news. They tell us to just ""get out there and live your fucking life"". They tell us WERE the crazy ones for isolating, WERE the crazy ones for thinking they could have Covid. 

I'm frustrated. I feel like the entire world is trying to gaslight me and I really am the crazy one and have to bemitted. Everyone around me is making me feel like i've dreamt this all up.

2679,"Dad recovered! + Household stayed healthy! I’ll start off by saying the scariest part for me had to be having my father isolated, every cough or every time he got sick I couldn’t be by his side or even check on him. The second scariest part was keeping myself and the rest of my family from getting infected. But with strict isolation we managed to stay avoid it. This subreddit and it’s members seriously helped me through some anxious days. Can’t thank some of you enough. 

The Timeline:
 
I went out of town for a few days for a few days so I wasn’t present for the first few days. The night I left my dad came down stairs  wrapped in a blanketplaining he felt cold and we should turn the AC up. Very strange request from anyone who stays in the southwestern US this time of year. He went to bed and I headed out early. By the time I came back he had self isolated and had all the classic symptoms. 

07/15 chills 
07/16 fatigue set in, he left work early 
07/17 extreme fatigue, body aches, chills 
07/18 extreme fatigue, terrible body aches , chills, smell and taste disappeared 
07/19 same as above 
07/20 same as above
07/21 same as above 
07/22 same symptoms and new fever set in 101-103.5
07/23 fatigue,  body aches , smell and taste disappeared , still 101 - 103fever , no appetite
07/24 fever broke, rest of the symptoms remained
07/25 Positive test results. GI distress (both ways) and new Cough appeared. Rest of the symptoms present but fever never returned
07/26 same symptoms 
07/27 same but noticeably less severe 
07/28 all symptoms but cough gone from one night to the next it seemed ! There was rapid improvement in all symptoms. 
He has been extremely hungry since smell and taste returned. 

Dad and fam tested 08/06 results were negative for everyone! Till this day dad still has a slight cough from time to time but rest of the symptoms arepletely gone. 

Through the ordeal Dad took Tylenol/ibuprofen swapped them out every 8-12 hours when he felt pain/ fever 
Famotidine helped with the GI symptoms.

2681,"I feel like the only person around whose goals/freedom/college got obliterated by covid-19 I can't tell anymore if I am overreacting to covid-19 or if my feelings are realistic. My feelings towards all the ""we should NEVER go back to normal"" or ""this IS the new normal"" people is just -- ???????.

I'm a college student, living away from my parents, who is now jobless. I was working for my university, and was supposed to graduate next year. I had a great job in the IT department, and by the time I graduated would have had 3 years of IT experience to get a better job in a better city. My current city has very little jobs available because everything's closed or on limited operations. We're not LA or Silicon Valley, we're a little midwestern town. My only options are McDonald's and Walmart now.

My classes have moved online and I am failing 2 of them, a big change from A's and B's. My uni still has no concrete plans to get back to in-person schooling, and my job won't be back until ""maybe august"". OK but I need money!! I don't qualify for stimulus money because my parents claim me, and I don't qualify for unemployment.

Everyone else around me is like, elated to stay at home. They're happy to be on reduced hours, or staying at home and still getting paid. Even the friends who don't have jobs are having no issues. And god forbid Iplain, because the same people are posting about how if you want things to change you're a piece of shit who is killing their grandma. Everyone's pressuring me to stick it out, but the odds of me getting my job and old life back are none if we'll be doing this ""off and on"" quarantine for the next 2 years like everyone's saying.

Idk I feel really depressed and angry! I'm skeptical that there will be economic support for my degree by the time I graduate, and if there is it will likely be ""work from home"" which I absolutely will not do. I can't continue studying/working/LIVING online, the instruction is abysmal and soooo not what I paid thousands of dollars for. I have to pay for rent, food, everything. I have parents and grandparents and a girlfriend too, who are at risk for covid-19. Plus I'm transgender, so I have to pay for my own medical care, and no I don't have family to support me. Sorry I don't have mommy and daddy to fall back on like every other unemployed/college 20's person seemingly does. But I'm the self centered piece of trash if I feel bad about this quarantine or wishing to at LEAST leave my house and enjoy the briefpany of others to distract from the fact that my life is fucking broke and upended :)

I don't have a lot of needs. I'm an introvert, I'm frugal, and I had modest ambitions to get a house and start a family someday. But now I feel like it'll never happen, and I'm a horrible person for mourning that. I'm sorry this is such a downer I just can't stand seeing everyone so happy and unaffected by this. It makes me feel like I'm overreacting, and that I'm crazy for being skeptical that life will just magically repair itself in a month or two. The only person who shares this feeling is my girlfriend, she's an immunopromised person and SHE's broke and hopeless as well.

2686,"Worked Out Wearing a Mask Today Went to the gym, our governor said starting today all public spaces require masks, and businesses are mandated to enforce mask wearing.  Gyms are iffy.  Basically no one forcing masks inside gyms.  I figured, whatever... I’ll give it a try.  We wear masks sometimes... and I’ve worn them on and off my whole life living abroad.  

First I ran on the treadmill.  I did sprint intervals for 30 min.  1 min@11mph, then 1min@6mph... on and off for half hour.  Then I did a light jog at 6mph for 10 min.  today was shoulders and leg day.  Typical medium lifting for about 1 hour (I do actually stop to check my phone now and then).  Mask the whole time.  

Did it bother me?  Yeah... it was digging into my ears a bit.  With my headphones and the mask around the ear... a bit snug.... 

but other than that.... nope.  

I also noticed... no one in the gym wore a mask.  Besides me.  At first, I felt a bit ... self conscious?  Why am I the only one wearing?

The next phase - I started thinking - “well, mask doesn’t protect me- it protects others... and I’m not sick... and they def not gonna protect me if they sick.... so F- it... I should take it off.”

I was THIS close..... but something stirred inside me.  I noticed every person I passed... they looked at me.  Some of them,  I imagine had thoughts like “this sheep is a conformist... .listening to whatever the government tells him to do”

Something irked me.  I’m the ONLY. One wearing a mask... and I’m the conformist?  I’m the only one that took a step considering mymunity.... and because they look at me funny... I’m suddenly about to say “meh, fuck themunity... die everybody! Cough on you!”?  Really?  For a few stares, I’m gonna give up my values that easy?  Am I that weak?  That lacking of conviction?

Then I realized something.  These people that refuse to wear, cause this mask is a shackle... a prison to enslave you by the government.... Why do you wear pants?  Why do you wear a shirt in public?  Why do you check if your fly is zipped and your cock isn’t hanging out when you exit the bathroom?  Cause you followed some government official telling you not to.  You listened to “the man” telling you it’s NOT ok to walk around with your private parts showing to the world.... yet somehow... THIS piece of cloth/paper on your face is a torture device?  Your family jewels are contained daily in a prison... yet THIS thing that will likely be only a few months of your life... is a prison sentence?  Oh, you can’t breathe cause you have a “medical” condition?  Are you THAT weak?  Is this country so weakened and crippled that you can’te together as amunity to care for each other.... to unite... and above all that you have the lung capacity of an asthmatic baby?  Well then... yeah.... maybe this country deserves to fall.  

So yeah.  I kept the mask on.  I don’t need to. No one else is wearing it at my gym.  No one cares.  fuck you.  I care.  God willing, I’m young (ish) and healthy... no family other than my loving wife (who’s even healthier than me).... knock on wood... I may get sick.. and die after I post this... but.... my current mood is.... I’m healthy and I likely don’t need to fear the Coof.... but fuck you. I care.  This country I came to be a part of... is screaming for help.  At every corner we need unity... not division.  This government, which I swore allegiance to when I became a citizen.... has asked for my help to just fucking wear a mask... something that doesn’t cause me any pain or suffering or difort... cause obviously I’m stronger than most of the locals here.... so yeah.  I’m gonna wear this mask.  Even when I run.  

Listen, while I understand the term “mandate” is a bit scary... and until the militaryes to put a muzzle on all our faces at gunpoint (which will never happen) - or we all unanimously agree one way or the other (again, never).... the reality is... some choose to wear... others choose not to wear.  You, who only wanted to open the economy up - as long as it was “easy and convenient” for you... choose not to wear.  You only cared for the economy as long as it didn’t involve you actually making a sacrifice for your fellow man.  Just call it like it is. It’s your right. 

But, STOP, touting “masks don’t do this” or “don’t help” that.  For every medical bullshit fact you can throw, there’s another fact that can be thrown right back at you.  So just stop.  You just choose to not do what the majority of Americans have worked hard to do for their fellow neighbor to get this country started again.  And that’s ok.  Just call it what it is  - you just don’t care.  

When I choose to help mymunity, and do something that we, the people, for the people, and by the people have asked each other to do - to help each other out - in this nation - when I do this thing - that harms NO ONE - but maybe helps someone out... when I’m actively sacrificing for what i believe might HELP mymunity and start the economy - and you choose not to.... well that makes me more an American than you.  

(That being said.... I do understand a mask at the gym is a bit overkill.... )

2687,"Rock and a hard place so I'm venting My gf decided a few weeks ago that she has it harder than everyone else in the world. She's too social to be stuck in the house. She'd rather get it and die than sit at home any longer. Of course that means fuck me, her kids, her parents, grandparents, siblings, etc. This ""I have to be around people or I'll die"" thing is apparently genetic as her mom feels exactly the same way and supports. She doesn't care as long as she can go back to feeling needed and important. 

My gf's oldest daughter stayed at her dad's house for a couple weeks beforeing back here. Her dad's gf works with patients in a nursing home with multiple cases. They're all at a cook out at her grandparents right now. Yesterday they were at our neighbors with multiple other neighbors for a cookout/pool party. 

She's been doing this for weeks. I can't talk sense into her. Ipared her to some of the idiots online. You know, the ""Coronavirus isn't dangerous; goes to cookout/event/etc; Coronavirus IS dangerous guys! I tested positive!"" type morons. She got all offended because she's ""nothing like those people."" 

I've lost all respect for her. She's putting her wants and desires before the health and safety of every single person around her. I honestly do not recognize her any more.

I've decided that if I'm going to be forced to be exposed, I may as well go back to work. I've got two jobs lined up. I'm getting some money and leaving. I can't be with someone I don't respect. I can't be with someone so weak and irresponsible.

I was going to end it there but just before posting I realized it probably wouldn't hurt to mention that I've talked to her on multiple occasions about finding ways of coping. Reddit and YouTube have helped me a lot. Seeing others dealing with things and the creativity out there as we attempt to ovee something so difficult together has made me feel weirdly connected despite not being at all.

2688,"I'm a young man (23) and this is how Coronavirus has affected my life. Hi everyone,

Much like a lot people, I've been feeling pretty alone throughout this ordeal. I wanted to share my story publicly in hopes that it can help my mental state going forward. If you take the time to read through this, I just want to say, thank you!

I don't think I'm alone when I say that the current state of the country is affecting me quite negatively. I lost my job back in late February before Covid-19. It was a big shock at the time because I was barely affording life at the time. I had roughly 1k dollars in my bank account. I was able to live for about a month off of my savings until I had to take out 1.5k from my 401,k. I was doing everything a young man would be doing after being fired. I tried applying for unemployment, but I was rejected. I applied for jobs everyday and got very few leads. I was feeling pretty bummed to put it mildly, then Covid happened.

The few job listing I had managed to get an interview for were cancelled and I was left feeling scared. I had 1.7k in the bank and knew that it wouldn't last long. I kept applying for jobs, to my dismay, I kept getting rejection letter after rejection letter. I cut back on a lot of basics in the process. I started shaving my head, eating beans and hot dogs and cancelled my bi-weekly therapy sessions. My actions were a primary response to my ineligibility to receive the 1.2k stimulus check (I selected ""could be claimed as dependent"" on my 2019 taxes). I have since tried re-applying for unemployment in hopes that my current state will take pity on my situation.

My plan at the beginning of the year was to re-enroll in online school in fall to finish a bachelors degree in psychology, in hopes of moving on to a doctorate program afterwards. However, that dream hasn't been shattered by Covid-19 yet, but I fear it will be. To alleviate some stress, I am switching to online college to make it cheaper and moving across the country, back to my home town. This would be at the beginning of next year (2021). All I can hope is that this change is a good one.

I'm trying to remain positive throughout this pandemic. I've been exercising daily, reading, cooking, writing a good bit and playing guitar. In spite of all these activities, I can't help but feel a major depression brewing in my brain. I've taken it upon myself to read Carl Jung and analyze my dreams (with the use of a dream dictionary), in hopes that I can at least ease some of the depressive feelings. I've pinpointed my issues to financial (I know that's a shocker!). I have 500 dollars in my account. I've started using credit cards to pay bills as this point. I'm waiting for something good to happen through my efforts, fingers crossed.

I always figured that life as a young adult would be uncontrollable at times, but now my expectations have been tested. I hope some of you can relate to this.

2690,"Anyone else live with people who are not doing their part in preventing the spread? TLDR:  I have to chase after my father like he's a child to get him to wash his hands to prevent the spread of COVID19.  Then he gets mad.


FULL TEXT:  Many adults in Hawaii still live with family due to the cost of living.  I'm curious if anyone is having difficulties with getting your family, or even roommates, toply with good hygiene?

I am having a hard time getting my father to wash his hands.  Prior to COVID19, he didn't always wash after using the bathroom.  I know this because my bedroom shares a wall with the bathroom and I can hear everything that goes on in there.  I usually heard the faucet go on after #2 but never after #1.  The few times I brought it up, he got mad and defensive.

Ever since COVID19, he has gotten better about washing after using the bathroom.  But now he gets annoyed when I ask him to wash his hands when hees home from the store.  He is an extrovert and simply can't stay home, he will find any reason to get out for a few hours, even if it's just to buy one thing.  I've tried not saying anything but then he just doesn't think to wash on his own!  The other day he got mad because he came home from the store and sat down on the couch.  I asked him to wash his hands.  He snapped and said he was going back out to do yardwork, he'd wash after that.  In my head, I'm thinking is it really that hard to wash your hands twice?!?!  He'd still be touching the doorknob and the TV remote and the refrigerator door handle even before going back outside.

He also sneezes directly into his hands and won't wash them unless I say something.  And of course he gets irritated.

I feel like all I can do is clean the best I can, hoping I kill germs before anyone else at home contracts them.  I also watch my father like a hawk when hees home, watching what he touches before he washes his hands, then going and disinfecting everything he touched.  I feel like a mother chasing after her son, only the son is my diabetic, almost 70 year old father.  I also know it's impossible to catch him not washing every single time.

2693,"Husband is ER physician and can’t self isolate - worried for him, me, and our toddler Hi all, thank you for this sub. I appreciate the support rather than the constant bad news of the other ones related to COVID.

Any suggestions (logistically and emotionally) regarding my situation- my husband is a US-based ER physician so he will be working in several large urban hospitals during this whole ordeal. I anticipate he will be exposed and will this bring home COVID to our toddler and me. I don’t really have any options of where else to go since I don’t want to leave him for potentially weeks or months. All our relatives within 3 hours drive are older and thus at higher risk.

Technically I am still expected to go to work but anticipate taking vacation/sick days as I wait for the tests toe back on my husband’s patients, as I don’t want to be a vector at my work.

Any thoughts on what I can do to manage all this? I’m less concerned about my work but am very worried for my child, my husband, and me.

2705,"So many feelings I don't know what to do with. All the grief is just weighing on me. I know we're all grieving something from this pandemic.  I was already grieving when this pandemic hit.  I'm 28 years old and I had to move out of my apartment and back in my parents house which is across the country where I live.  I was grieving my financial independence, the life that I built, the friendships I made, the relationship I had, etc.  When it all happened, I still had hope.  I had hope that I was going to save up enough money to get my independence back.  I got a job that was supposed to pay well and I was going to hustle my way back to my old life, but would have had enough saved to improve it.  Now business has slowed down and I'm not making as much as I expected and hoped for.  I'm grieving the timeline.  I'm grieving my hope.  I'm grieving the opportunity to move on from the relationship I lost.  I lived in a lower-risk area so my friends and my ex have more opportunity to socialize with each other outside and in small gatherings.  I can't do that where I am now.  My ex already found someone because dating opportunities aren't as restricted.  My friends are getting together in small gatherings.  I'm just sitting here and going through the motions, not seeing friends, not dating, not having any energy to do what is available to me (youtube videos, reading, meditating, etc).

Days are awful.  I spend my days staring at my ceiling and closing my eyes, hoping to fall asleep, but I can't because it's daytime.  I'm least depressed at night time because it's almost bedtime and I know I can escape reality for a few hours and visit thefort of my dreams.  I was already depressed.  I was already grieving. When this pandemic hit, these feelings of hopelessness and loss only increased.   How can I be in so much pain and feel numb at the same time? That's how I feel right now.  I don't know how but I wish I could stop feeling this way.  I even started taking Tylenol because I read that there is overlap in the physical and emotional pain receptors and that Tylenol can target that part.  I can't tell if it's really helping, but I don't want to stop because for all I know the pain could be worse without it.  Now I'm rambling but my next therapy session isn't until Tuesday so I need some outlet.

Update: Thank you all for your responses. I really appreciate it. Just FYI I’ve been taking less than the maximum dose of Tylenol since it’s extended release. I see a therapist and my antidepressants have been increased so time will tell how that will work.  I want to allow myself to grieve and be sad but the pain is barely bearable so I numb it until the time passes. Also, please don’t be afraid to share your own experiences with grief on this thread.

Everyone keeps saying the lockdown won't last, that we'll ""get through this together,"" ""the best minds are working on it,"" ""everyone in the world is feeling like you are.""

They're empty platitudes that tell me to feel better without giving me actual reason why I should. People refuse to back them up. 

Can someone give me some, *any* actual proof from the people in charge that this lockdown will end within the next month or two? Because all I hear is the same recycled feel good messages. I need *proof!* Not opinion or hearsay. Not models or data. I need a quote from someone who actually has say in when we're all allowed outside again to say when they'll let us. Because until then I don't believe a single thing anyone says because without proof it means nothing to me. 

I don't want advice, or links to breathing exercises or yoga or any other nonsense that doesn't and never has worked for me. I need a light at the end of this tunnel. A REAL one. Not a guess or speculation. I need a link to an article or quote that SAYS we'll be out of this soon.

2713,"I am feeling depressed all the time now You know back when I was feeling these things I initially thought I was just sad. Sad that everything has changed from having to social distance, isolating and basically keeping either yourself safe or your family around you safe from COVID19.   


Lately though I've been feeling sad every day. I barely can get up out of bed in the morning wanting to wake up to another day of isolating myself from all the wonderful connections i've made. Sure people say ""Oh just zoom call or talk to someone over the phone."" It just isn't the same! Nothing is the same as taking your friends out to a nice meal and enjoying a conversation with them. Nothing beats going up to a friend who you haven't seen in a while and giving them a hug or a hand shake. Even if I met up with a friend and we social distant ourselves I would still be upset that I can't be near them. That when I look at them I can't see their lovely faces because we have to wear masks to protect ourselves and everyone around us.   


I know everyone is going through the same I get that. It's just this has hit me hard really emotionally and each day keeps going by living through the same crap. I don't think I have ever missed anything this bad before.

2715,"The thought that these changes will never end is making me consider suicide **Note: I posted this on** r/Christianity **but didn't get any response so that's why I mention my faith a lot fyi.**

&#x200B;

This  year (like for many) has been horrendous. I've always struggled with  anxiety and mental health issues but with my support at church, therapy  and proper medication I was very in control of my anxiety until March  threw the country on its head. My anxiety worsened as things just got  worse and worse again, around April I became more hopeful. I attended a  week long inpatient therapy program when I was at my worst and one of  the workers was a pastor and helped me a lot in thinking more positively  about the future and that things would get better eventually.

May  16th, 2 days before my 21st birthday my mother called me and told me my  sister (23) who had been clean for 4 years died that morning of a drug  overdose. I was very close with her at the end especially we spent more  time together than we ever did before because of the quarantine and that  I'm eternally grateful for.

After her death I did have a spark of hope to feel more positive about things  just as a way to cope and that God would deliver us from this madness  eventually and I'd be able to go back to church. But slowly that spark  has died as the situation worsens and more and more I fear the social  distancing guidelines will stay permanently fixed laws out of fear. I  have extreme difficulty wearing a mask for any lengthy period of time  due to anxiety and claustrophobia. Meaning I can never return to church  or my young adult group that has been an anchor for support in my life for the past year and half.

Even  though they have ""reopened"" I've done my best to stay in touch with my  pastors and my friends but It breaks my heart seeing everything so  ruined by the state that going back would make me more heart broken. I  tried at least attending my group once and my anxiety over everyone  wearing masks made me leave because I was verging on a panic attack. So  much has fallen apart, and things don't look like they will be getting  better. I try so hard to have faith they will but things are doing nothing but getting worse from everything I overhear on the news. Suicide has crept back into my head, I know I cannot do that to my  parents right now, but the thought doesn't stop entering my mind. With how much worse things are going to get and stay that way very long term, suicide is really beginning to feel like the only way out. I don't think I have the strength of character to fight through this and hold out to feel happy again until this ends which it may never. I'm so tired and burnt out from all that's happened and I just want to give up. The mask issue makes getting a job (as I graduated my tech-school in march and have been unemployed sense) out right impossible as people are likely to not hire me if I start making demands.

I  want to trust God like I should, I think that's what I struggle with right now when all I see in unending negativity about the future and that things will be like this and worse forever. And if there are how can I be confident that I can be happy and not feel that suicide is the only way to escape what Covid has done. If you read this  whole thing thank you for any insight you can provide, thank you very  much and I'm sorry this was so long.

**Edit: I carefully read everyone's responses and this has been helpful. Even if I still have a lot of challenges to tackle ahead that are really keeping me depressed and constantly nervous, I'm happy to know there are others that don't just think zoom meetings are an adequate substitute I should be happy with permanently. I also had no idea the vaccine was anything more than a click bait false hope rumor since I avoid the news as much as possible due to how horribly it provokes my anxiety. I'm going to try alternative ""mask"" methods regardless of if they actually protect me or not as the virus itself and getting sick doesn't actually stress me out anymore and I have no real anxiety involving that. My anxiety is entirely based on my social anxiety returning the social fear I have and what others think of me and that people will keep these laws in place forever out of fear.

2723,"Trying to not be afraid, but failing quite miserably I have been reading this sub for about a week. This whole thing sucks, but I'm so glad I'm not alone. I have been dealing with a lot of anxiety mainly because my family may not be able to weather this very well. My mom has a lot of pre-existing conditions including being on immunosuppressants. I have been spending time working on letting go of the things I can't control. I am trying to move beyond worrying about every sniffle and scratchy throat. I'm reminding myself that it is still cold and flu season and with temps increasing and snow melting, seasonal allergies.

I'm just frustrated.  People aren't taking this seriously; they don't even take the flu seriously. I am in charge of cleaning my church campus and last week was absolute hell for me. I feel like I'm not doing enough. At church today, I was hyperaware of people coughing into their hands, touching their faces, not thoroughly washing their hands, using hand sanitizer then wiping it off on their pants.

People are treating this like it's some kind of joke. For my mom, this isn't a joke. I will say the same thing about the flu. For my dad, it isn't a joke because he developed pneumonia after getting the flu. For my friend who attends this church, it isn't a joke because she survived sepsis last year. There are many vulnerable people who attend my church. As for me, well, viral respiratory infections kick my ass.

Even though it may not help, I am planning on putting hand washing reminders by every sink. I wish people understood that loving thy neighbor includes getting needed vaccines, washing your hands, staying home when you're sick. There is nothing holy about going to church sick.

To try to stay sane, I pray and read my Bible. I have been meditating on Psalm 91. In my prayers, I obviously pray for a miracle and protection. I also pray for those who are sick, those who lost loved ones, the frontline healthcare workers, public health officials, the scientists, and the Trump Administration. I'm also praying for all of you.",39,0.96,ffoywz,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ffoywz/trying_to_not_be_afraid_but_failing_quite/,5,NA,2020-03-09,-14,129,-0.10852713178294573
2725,"This is all just too much.. I try not to post too much negative stuff on here, but I feel led to because I am certain that many of you can relate. In my opinion, the current state of things is extremely depressing. No, I am not  exaggerating. We are nearly 7 months into a global pandemic with over 7 million cases and over 200,000 deaths. We are witnessing many examples of unfair treatment towards black men and women by our police officers and our criminal justice system. We are dealing with a very contentious election cycle where it is yet another situation of choosing the ""lesser of two evils"". Our unemployment has tripled in 6 months' time.

On a personal level, I have been struggling with job loss, social isolation as a result of the pandemic, and the constant anxiety surrounding the pandemic, as well as a plethora of other issues that we have faced this year. Every passing day, I feel more and more hopeless, lost, and cynical about the current state of things. I am constantly thinking that things won't get any better and that none of this really seems to matter.

I keep thinking about where my life was around this time last year, or even earlier this year. I realize that there was so much about our old lives that we all took for granted, whether it be being able to work or being able to freely hug a friend or a family member. I took the warmth and the smiles of strangers in the grocery store for granted. Right now, everything just feels so cold and distant. Now, we are forced to cover half of our faces with masks and keep distance from everyone. Now, our safest bet for any real and meaningful contact with our fellow man is through either video chats or text messaging. Don't get me wrong, technology and social media are amazing ways to stay connected with the people near and dear to us. However, none of that is nearly the same as being able to hug them or going out and really enjoying each other'spany. While I have never been a highly physically affectionate person, I definitely miss being able to hug, fist bump, and high five my friends and family.

I know that this will definitely pass in the near future.",39,0.96,j2vvyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j2vvyv/this_is_all_just_too_much/,7,Support,2020-10-01,-8,125,-0.064

But my friends/family see it differently, and this anger is just getting pent up.

Any advice, stats, or goodebacks tomon arguments? And also yes anger/resent help will gladly be taken.

2727,"The longer the virus goes on the more I want to give up I just want to make it clear that by giving up I dont mean my life. I know I still have my friend's, family and my girlfriend that I would never do that to them.

When I say giving up it just means giving up on the things that used to make me happy. Being able to travel to events, conventions, concerts, malls, to see my friends, going to parks and meeting new people. All of that is just gone and I am giving up that it will evere back. I may not ever end my own life, but that doesn't mean I'm living a happy one.

Sure I got people who love me and I love them. I should just be happy and grateful for that and I am. Just when there were so many things that you loved to do, but you can't do them anymore or a watered down version of it it's depressing.

Not to mention now I fear the virus anytime I go out. With the CDC changing things on how we can get the virus who knows what to look out for. What if you could get it walking in an area that waspletely empty, but because one person past by it earlier with the virus you somehow get it by passing through that same area the other person walked. What if you get it from touching something on a shelf that some other person touched. Folks say you can wear gloves, but then I have the anxiety of taking my gloves off wrong and touching it. Then they say that a face mask isn't as helpful to you wearing it more as it helps protect other people so I still fear the virus even wearing a mask. This just constant fear of the virus the moment you step outside of your home is awful. I know I shouldn't be worrying to that extent of getting the virus no matter what I do, but it can't be helped that I feel like this. 

All of this watered down version of life mixed in with the fear of the virus from even seeing someone that's more than six feet away is a horrible. Even if they give us the all clear and to not worry about it I'll still be worried. If they never say it's safe to go out without all these restrictions it'll be depressing.

I just feel like I'll never be able to go out and enjoy the life that I used to have. That I'll never be able to go out without fearing of getting the virus. Even if I go out with protection I will still be anxious about being out.i feel for others too with how this virus has been affecting people. Seeing folks losing their lives and losing their loved ones to this it's painful to see.

2731,"I'm now starting to get really worried about coronavirus I'm usually the type of guy that doesn't worry about diseases like this. I remember the last two times stuff like this happened, with Ebola and Zika, the media blew it way out of proportion and made it seem worse than it was, when neither really spread to the United States and largely stayed in their areas. I assumed coronavirus was just another Ebola, something that would remain mainly in China, and then spread out to a couple isolatedmunites outside there, and that would be the end of it.

I thought wrong.

Now, schools have been closed for two weeks in my area. At first, I thought I was happy that school would be closed, but then I started getting anxious once I realized 1. just how long of a time period this was, and 2. the fact that stuff like this ideally shouldn't be happening

In addition, many major events have been cancelled. Given this, it makes me wonder just how much of life will be disrupted before coronavirus peaks. I legit feel like I'm in some apocayptic movie or something. I'm also concerned for my grandparents, and if they'll get it.

I think the biggest thing that keeps me worried is the relative lack of good news. I keep on hearing ""millions will get infected"", or ""it won't go away for months or years"", and honestly, that just worries me the fuck out. Not only that, but everyone seems to talk ONLY about coronavirus, and it's at that moment I really get worried. Even the r/coronavirus subreddit seems to have few good news on it. I know the fact we're in a state of emergency means we can get help, but...

We're still in an emergency...

And that's the main thing I'm concerned about. How bad will this get? I'm just afraid that no matter how much I isolate myself, I can't avoid it. And even if I did, it still wouldn't prevent my anxiety. I just want life to return to normal, but I get scared that maybe it won't, and maybe I have to live with the fact conditions like this may last for weeks or even months.

This year, 2020, was the year I was going to turn 18 and be an adult. I feel as if this is aing-of-age moment for me, but not the one I deserved. What's more, the rest of my household isn't that worried, my brother is just as happy as he usually is, my mother is trying to calm me and isn't worried about it either, and my step-father is...just being quiet as usual.

I legit haven't had this much stress since 2017, when my family was having drama. When that happened, I almost experienced anhedonia, which is the inability to have pleasure, and that might happen with the coronavirus in 2020. I just wish I could focus on my own pleasures and just have fun, but it's hard when the world seems to be getting worse and worse.

It's moments like these that make me really nostalgic and wish I could go back to the past. I wish I could go back to 2012 when the biggest thing people were worried about was an apocalypse that never happened, or even 2014, which was when Ebola was going around, but it didn't turn out as people as people said, and it turned out to be overhyped. I just miss my past and my childhood. I wish I could be 9 or 10 again.

Honestly, I just wonder how my brother does it. I know he has autism, but I wish I was still as carefree as he is. I do sometimes go into states like his, especially when I'm actually happy and having fun, but now I worry when I'll be able to have fun again. When will things reopen, and how long will this period of fear last for?

I suppose the only good thing toe out of this is people will start practicing good hygeine finally...

But other than that, I'm especially sad/mad because I feel this year was ruined for me. I made this out to be ""my year"" and the year I start doing things, but now I fucking can't because of stupid coronavirus. Now I'm basically crippled in a state of constant fear until this fucking ends...

And when will it end...my brain wishes it would just end and be quick, but unfortunately, pandemics like this are usually slow and painful to sit through, watching as everything, and possibly everyone, bes a victim. As a teenager, I'm not afraid I'll die from it, but I definitely don't want to catch it.

The media says it won't end until a year from now, and that millions will gets infected, including in the US. However, because the media sometimes exaggerates things, my prediction is that coronavirus will likely peak in April at least, and July at most. Even still, I can't wait that long. I enjoy alone time, but I actually feel claustrophobic now with the proposition I CAN'T escape. I wish I could ignore it, but when it's everywhere...I just can't. I can't escape hearing about coronavirus just as much as I'm afraid to leave the house now. I legit feel as if my house is a prison. And what if the worst-case scenarios are accurate...

And I'm not just worried about the virus, I'm worried about everything that'lle of it and its impact. This isn't like 9/11 where it killed tons of people at once (and I don't live in New York so I couldn't have died), this is something that kills people gradually, and that shit scares me even more.

What I'm getting is it's not just the immediate deaths, but the ensuing impact. I see tons of entertainment projects getting cancelled and delayed, and it makes me scared if it'll eventually impact businesses to the point of society basically shutting down. Or if enterainment will be so badly affected that literally everything is just reruns. There's also the financial impact. I'm worried if the economy is so badly damaged, that if we go homeless. Or what about shortages that cause me to fucking starve?

You know what this feels like? I feel as if I'm in some extremely poor country where diseases like this are to be expected, and the economy pretty much doesn't exist. I'm not spoiled or anything, but I definitely didn't ask for this kind of life.

So, I have been in my house 90-95% of the time with very limited outside interaction beyond my immediate family. Things were okay enough for a while and then I started to feel somewhat lonely. So, I reached out to my friend (25F) to see if she wanted to do a socially distanced hangout. I proposed that we could walk around my neighborhood or sit in my backyard. She said that she couldn't do that because she had to move stuff out of her apartment and get ready to go to her cousin's birthday party. Instead, she suggested that we ride and talk while she grabbed a couple of things from her apartment. While in the car, I had my mask on and the windows were rolled down. She wasn't wearing a mask at all. When we got to her apartment, I tried to maintain a 6 feet distance when possible. She then asked why I kept backing away from her and said that she wasn't sick and so forth. I just told her that I felt nervous because I spent so much time at home isolated. When we got back in the car, she wanted to take a selfie and asked me to take my mask off. I then told her no. She said that I needed to live a little. Also, she has been frequently been hanging out and gathering with multiple people.

2742,"Has A Lack of Quality Face-to-Face Interaction Increased Your Negative Thoughts? Before the pandemic, I suffered from mild anxiety issues, especially social anxiety. I wouldn't say it was debilitating, but it was enough to be noticeable, and often times a hindrance.

Now, due to the pandemic, I had to isolate for a few months, during which I worked from home, alone.

The first two months went by like a breeze. For a few years now, I had built the habit of calling my friends as opposed to texting them, which helped me not feel alone at all.

At the same time, I started getting more vulnerable with my friends, and the social anxiety I had for years slowly started fading away. I started getting more confident when talking to others. My tendency to spend a lot of time daydreaming about impressing people disappeared. I realized that I am actually someone who is liked by others and has very good social skills.

But as soon as the anxiety started fading away, I started getting other forms of anxious thoughts.

Like:

“The isolation has caused the social side of my brain to deteriorate and I am losing empathy. This is the reason why I am not anxious anymore.”

Or my favorite:

“I was only treating people with respect because of my social anxiety. Now with the anxiety gone, I will start to treat them like shit.”

In short, the thoughts were how isolation has caused me to ‘change’ and be a bad person, and I will hurt other people. The thoughts hit their peak in the fourth month and I decided to move back in with my parents.

One interesting thing that I have noticed during this is that whenever I indulge in some quality face-to-face interaction, these thoughts seem to disappear. This includes the time when I spent two days in the office and interacted with a work friend of mine and the rare occasions when I have video calls with my friends.

I've been fighting the urge to do something reckless for a while now, but the announcement he made a few days ago sent me over the edge. I'm angry. I can't accept any of this as the ""new normal.""

I've been losing a lot of body fat since the lockdown, and since I'm bordering on underweight, I'm worried this could be dangerous if it continues for much longer.

One of the people who taught me that was autistic, just like me, and had a lot of other medical and neurological problems that caused a steady loss of skills. I read hir blog and interacted online, and I learned so much.

I just learned sie died a few days ago after sie went into the hospital with influenza. Sie used a CPAP at night even when healthy. Because of multiple medical problems, doctors have in the past tried to talk hir into refusing medical treatment and dying... but sie wanted to live, and enjoyed life. When sie went into the hospital sie was having problems finding an aide... was that why sie got so sick?

And now I just can't stop thinking about it. The worst nightmare for disabled people during this pandemic is that we'll be denied medical treatment we need because we are disabled and seen not to be worth it. Did they take hir CPAP away? Did sie die of COVID, or just from influenza because they made the choice not to treat hir?

I really need to talk to someone about how I am feeling since I don't want my family to worry. 

So I travelled to germany on March 7th and returned home March 14th. I was very much aware of the situation and tried my best to be safe, washed my hands and all that. When I came back I isolated myself from everyone and haven't been out since. 
The problem is that 3 days ago I started to feel some chest pressure. I still can breathe but I feel like my chest is heavy. It is very ufortable but I can't say that it hurts. I don't have a fever or a cough. I am just feeling tired and worrying that the virus is in my lunges. Should I worry ? Could be just stress ?

2752,"I cried at work today because I cant handle the stress of COVID I've been having such a hard time mentally. Sometimes I feel like it's no big deal, and I'll be okay. But that's just because I'm forcing myself to stop thinking about the virus to try and get a moment's peace.

There was one confirmed case in my state last week. As of today, there are 96. It feels like everything around me is spinning out of control and I'm in a horror movie. Global epidemics are my biggest fear and I feel so trapped and hopeless.

I have a very very hard time thinking of what's going to happen if I get sick. I'll either have to lose my job from staying home, or go and get tested, and be a damn confirmed case and have them talk about me like I'm some kind of animal. ""Receiving care at this time"", things like that. The idea of being added to the numbers alone makes me stop in absolute fear. I cant handle that. I cant be in isolation, I cant be taken and held down for 2 plus weeks with doctors surrounding me at all times. 

If I get sick, I *WILL* kill myself. I cannot see any feasible way that I'll  be able to continue living as if nothing happened.

I got pulled to the side by one of my coworkers after I'd made some remarks about my fear of being a number, in which he told me that I would have to be tested, because I'd either lose my job or possibly get our immunpromised coworker critically ill. And i started crying like a stupid little bitch. I didnt want to cry but I've always been sensitive and so it really hurt to know that I had no way around it. 

Idk what to do anymore. I'm honestly considering killing myself at this point. I feel so dragged down and hopeless and I dont know what I'm supposed to do. I cant work from home. My job (grocery store, deli counter) wont close. I'm at a loss, it just feels like everything is shattering around me.

\-Wearing a mask in any sort ofmon area (kitchen, living room, den).

\-Using the basement bathroom to go to the bathroom, brush my teeth, and shower (my parents would stick with the 2nd floor bathroom and not use the basement one). 

\- Still sleeping in my 2nd floor room (my parents' room is next to mine, but obviously separated by doors/walls), but always making sure my door is closed and the windows open.

- my lease will end because my roommates of 7 years are leaving, and I don't feel safe living alone / am overwhelmed trying to figure out where I could move, how to move, which places offer me work, etc. 

- Two months ago when ruling out COVID-19 for fatigue / breathing stuff I learned I have Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and those symptoms were part of dysautonomia. I'm working hard to care for this, but meds are interacting and it's really difficult still to manage and keep adjusting.

I am usually able to manage, but I don't know what I can and can't focus on right now, how to focus enough to deal with any of these, how to make good decisions when in constant low grade crisis mode, etc. Any ideas, personal anecdotes, etc. about managing some of these (esp making major life choices when struggling) would be wonderful.

2785,"I Don't Know How To Balance ""Covid Prevention and Self-Care"" and ""Not Losing Everything To Depression"" /This might just be a bit of a vent, or a plea for help. I dunno.   


It feels like everyone's giving out free passes to act a bit more selfishly these days, and for good reason - you need to practice self-care more than ever. However, as someone suffering from depression and anxiety, so much of life involved, like, \*forcing\* myself to do things.

The more time passes, the less I feel capable of being with anyone. Like, in any capacity, and not just because of safety. Rather, it's exacerbated by the safety issue.   
I'm way more withdrawn and I have so little energy, and in the past, that's always meant forcing myself to go out and see someone, or do something. Now I can't. The world feels horribly unsafe. I don't have insurance. I feel like I so much as look at a public bench the wrong way and it's all over.

I  love my girlfriend so damn much, but we're like, on Month #6 of us just saying ""I miss you"" to each other. Going to see her is such a daunting task. I feel so damn unsafe and that keep reinforcing the deepening feeling of like, badly \*not\* wanting to visit her. I just feel like I barely even have the energy to say hello to her online, or even say ""I miss you."" She's the only one I care to talk to, other than the partner I'm living with.

My platonic partner (the one I'm living with), well, he's easy to talk to, because we live together. But we only live together because I was unemployed before the virus hit, and needed a place to stay. Now I don't even look for work, I'm just mooching off him. I keep telling myself I'm going to look, but I never manage to do more than a few token applications. I toss out the wrong resume for some job that irrelevant to me and it's the most I can do before breaking down in a nervous fit. Before that, I used to spend tons of time in the coworking areas in the city. Despite being poor, I became known there for my previous job, so I learned to ovee my issues and talk to people and network and such. But all of this isolation just feels like it's undone everything.

And it's like, I *get* that I'm supposed to be concerned for myself more right now. We're all going through unprecedented times, and all. But I just feel like this stuff ispounding all of the ways I tear myself apart, and I don't have a way of putting them back. I don't want to lose my girlfriend or the part of my life that sheprises, but honestly? I think about her and her daughter less and less. And that's fucking me up deeply, because I love them both so much, and yet I apparently have the capacity to just be too....I dunno, I want to say ""lazy"", to think about them. I can't keep dates to like, sync movies or anything. As for my partner, I'm just increasingly content to mooch off him and let him pay for my rent and tolerate my filthy room.

I dunno. I feel like I'm bing a monster, and the actual physical ways ofbating these issues feel so off-limits now. I keep freaking out at the thought of going outside. I can feel myself getting more and more selfish - like, I try not to show it, but I have less and less interest in updates regarding a loved one's cancer recovery. This is bad.

I don't know what to do. Last time I tried to go out, I had a panic attack and my partner got close to calling 911. I don't feel up to this task. I hate this person I'm bing, and I feel powerless to do better.

2786,"High risk, living with a plague rat I live in the USA, in a city which is currently a COVID hot spot.

I rent the basement of a friend's house. I have various physical glitches that make me high-risk, including asthma. Colds usually make my asthma flare up; the flu once put me in the hospital. Therefore, high-risk.

My friend is currently upstairs having a get-together with some ""friends from high school"", including several children. Nobody is wearing a mask. They're all indoors. He hasn't even opened the windows.

Yesterday, when he went to work, I noticed both his masks were still on the kitchen table. He has repeatedly not been wearing a mask to work or in public. This bothers me because he is young and healthy and likely to get an asymptomatic case and spread it when he goes to work--a job which involves repeatedly going into people's homes.

He's been having D&D games in the living room. I asked the group to please have them online, but they won't. He only sets up a web cam so I can participate remotely from the basement. 

To make this worse, I am disabled and don't drive; so he is the only transportation I have if I don't want to use a taxi. With his behavior getting more and more careless as the pandemic gets worse and worse, I feel like I simply can't risk letting him drive me anywhere. Luckily, I grow some of my own food in the garden out back.

I'm so tired of him being so absolutely careless. He seems to think that he's going to get COVID no matter what happens, so he might as well stop taking precautions. He doesn't understand that as a a young, healthy person, he could be a disease vector and spread COVID to everyone whose house he enters during the course of his job, everyone whoes into our house--and very likely to me, thorough the air conditioning system which we share. 

I was hoping that I wouldn't have to isolate myselfpletely because he would be careful enough that I could consider him part of my household. But it's bing increasingly clear to me that I am going to have to isolate myself from him, too.

I need to lay down the law: He is not toe downstairs. I can't take rides from him anymore; I need to get my groceries delivered. I feel like I should quit that D&D game, too, because if I participate, I'm enabling these social gatherings which are entirely too risky.

I thought my friend was a kind person. He has always helped me in the past, and has always helped other people. But it seems now that his willingness to help stops when it inconveniences him.

I stopped volunteering at the library when the pandemic hit--the library is my favorite place in the whole world. I've made over a thousand cloth masks for my neighbors. My friend has even donated money for supplies for those masks--but he's got a steady job and he's got money to spare, if his patronage of restaurants and his high-end electronics are any indication. It seems that when ites to going out of his way, he no longer wants to help other people. He doesn't have the patience or the self-control to wait this out, to be careful, to avoid bing a COVID vector.

I worry that he thinks I'm a coward, that I'm paranoid. But that's not the way it is. This is a worldwide pandemic, it's killing off our elders. My grandmother just died two weeks ago, alone in her nursing home because of this pandemic, and I couldn't even go to her funeral! This is real, and he doesn't seem to understand it.

What can I do? How do I deal with this? I thought he cared.",33,0.92,i62z10,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i62z10/high_risk_living_with_a_plague_rat/,13,Support,2020-08-09,-14,184,-0.07608695652173914
2787,"When your best friends behaviors are infuriating My friends are basically acting as if the pandemic was over. All of them get together with each other inside and do not wear masks or socially distance. when I explained to them that that makes me ufortable and that I will choose to only see them outside and wearing a mask, they reply asking why I do not trust them.

It's not exactly an issue of trust, seeing as covid-19 can be asymptomatic in many of its carriers. I think them asking me this reveals a shallow and ignorant way of thinking on their behalf about the virus and how it spreads. Just because someone is a close friend doesn't mean they cant spread it to you.

2788,"It's all kicking off again in my county and i dont know if i can do lockdown again.... Im in Colorado, and our county was in the news a few days ago saying that if cases dont stop rapidly rising, within 2 weeks we'll be on lockdown again.

People are starting to hoard canned, dry and frozen foods at the grocery store again, not even a month after things had finally (mostly) normalized and you could consistently get what you needed when you went in there. Today i saw a guy put (at my rough count) TWENTY boxes of pasta in his cart. One box of pasta feeds my family of 3 for dinner and lunch the next day. Nobody, unless they own a restaurant or something, needs 20 boxes.

Also they have a sign at the door that says you have to wear a mask, and i watched people walk in wearing one, then take it off and put it in their pocket while walking around. People without masks on coughing into their hands and then touching all the merchandise, like nothing has changed from March. The stores arent enforcing masks, and the staff arent paid enough to care.

I get masks arentfortable. Im 12 weeks pregnant, and somehow still manage to wear one even when the morning sickness is so bad that having cloth over my mouth makes me want to vomit. I suck on a sour candy to settle my stomach and keep the damn thing on. But all these ""muh freedumbs"" assholes dont care about walking around coughing and infecting people, as long as their rights arent infringed!

2789,"A Conflicted Scientist This whole pandemic and the public response to it has been incredibly hard on me as a scientist who studied immunology, mental health, and public health (I now work in science admin). 

A lot of this education would point me towards the pro-lockdown direction, but, instead I'm feeling very anti-lockdown lately and I've been getting backlash from my fellow scientists as a result. 

The thing is, my truth is very different from what they are experiencing. They have the luxury of telling the general public that we need to lockdown or cancel mass gatherings until there is a vaccine while still having the ability to either work from home or having to work for the healthcare system (and also acknowledging that the average vaccine takes a decade to be mass-produced). While I have to sit at home and listen to my roommates, who both work for the restaurant industry, talk about wanting tomit suicide because their dream jobs are cancelled until further notice. I work for the research side of a major hospital and we are facing the possibility of layoffs and furloughs because the hospital lost so much money to having to cancel non-COVID related procedures and the fact that job-loss means loss of health insurance in the US. 

Theplete disregard for the collateral damage caused by these lockdowns has me furious. Mental health, substance abuse, stress-induced illnesses, homelessness, and the fear of going to the doctor leading to those who could've been saved dying or having long-term damage (referring to the fact that heart attacks, strokes, and other non-COVID related emergencies are at a decline lately due to people not going to the ER anymore) are ALSO PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH! We seem to be sacrificing all other areas of public health for one small area for a disease that's proving more and more to be LESS deadly than we originally thought for the average person. 

It's bing harder and harder to respect scientists through all of this. They have clearly bought into the doom and gloom and havepletely abandoned all rational thought while insulting those who are suffering due to lockdowns. I am a big proponent of scientists getting a better reputation in the general public, but this is definitely ruining that for me. 

Don't get me wrong, I have also been in contact with amazing scientists that are focusing on this disease. Having a virologist as one of my program heads has been a huge help and he's been very reasonable about all of this. He seems similar to me with this: he wants the push to be towards funding contact tracing, antibody testing, and increased incidence testing. He despises the fact that these lockdowns have been extended without these, basically making them and the collateral damage last longer. There seems to be a growing number of scientists and healthcare workers who are worried about the collateral damage as well, and I hope they get more attention soon. The longer we push these lockdowns and ignore those who are suffering who might not have if things were at least somewhat normal, the more I fear that scientists and politicians will not be trusted in the future, even if they are proposing reasonable restrictions- and that can be very, very dangerous.",35,0.78,gj2zt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gj2zt0/a_conflicted_scientist/,20,Trigger Warning,2020-05-14,-19,195,-0.09743589743589744

2792,"No delivery times available through the store or delivery apps. Take out and drive thru gets expensive. But I’m a bad person if I go to the grocery store. I’ve seen it multiple times since this all started. Essential workers from grocery stores and pharmaciesplaining about customers thanking them foring to work during this crazy time. I understand there is a lot of warranted frustration to have about a minimum wage job being considered “essential”, but you can’t get mad at the customers who are doing the only thing they can to show you they appreciate you. 
The people saying thank you have nothing else to offer. It’s not like you’re allowed to take tips (I’ve tried offering), so they just say thank you. It’s an act done with good intentions. 
That “family” you see and think to yourself “wtf why did all of them have toe out” could be people from different families relying on one person for a ride to the store. That person who didn’t buy enough groceries for you to think it was an essential trip might be spending all they have on a few groceries to get them by. 
I think I posted here before about going to cvs and waiting for the cashier to tell me what register to go to. She had to finish up her conversation with another employee about how they’ve been so busy and nobody cares about their health. I went in there because my shopping trips have be very spread out, very large, very stressful. I forgot my toddlers toothpaste. She ran out and I tried to use adult toothpaste but it was hurting her mouth. I went to cvs because it was the most “in and out” place. I look like a fool holding a minuscule item in my hand during an epidemic but it was essential to my family. Left their feeling like a big dumb ass. 
I’m not going to lie, I kind of copped an attitude with a grocery store employee on this sub earlier under a different name. I have a couple reddit accounts, I didn’t make this toe back andplain. But it’s really bothering me, this isn’t to just continue an argument. 
So I’m a server. I don’t work right now and once everything starts being paid out, I’ll be making more on unemployment than I did when I was working. I’m making more than my boyfriend who used to make a lot more than me and he’s still working. I make more on unemployment than the people stocking my shelves at the store. I would be effing fuming —— towards thepany I work for. I know nurses right now who are also livid about their hazard pay they’ll be receiving for being on the front lines. They’re not on here bitching at the people they are helping (their “customers”). 
There’s no need to hate on people for needing food. There aren’t a whole lot of options for avoiding the grocery store.
Everyone has the right to feel however they want. Especially during such a messed up time. The people who are thanking while buying groceries aren’t the problem. It’s places like Walmart, meijer, etc who somehow can’t cough up money to make these frontline workers feel like they’re beingpensated. Can’t even set up a thing where at the end of a transaction, “would you like to round up your total to help support our employees working the front lines?” 
I’m right there with you. I’m not a conservative. I’ve worked minimum wage til I became a server. Corporations want the little people to get mad at each other and forget that they are actually the problem.

2796,"Maybe infected, feel awful about everyone I had contact with Apologies for the long post. I know that there’s not really any advice beyond what I’m already doing, but I need to vent with the anonymity of the internet.

Three days ago, I had to go to the ER because it was so hard for me to breathe. After they did my vitals and blood tests, they concluded that I have a “viral respiratory syndrome with bronchospasms.” Because I hadn’t been out of the country, I didn’t qualify for a coronavirus test; all they could test me for was influenza and bacterial pneumonia, both negative. They had to give me two albuterol treatments to be well enough to go home.

Of course, I have been self-quarantining since I got back from the hospital. I don’t have asthma, but the tiniest bit of exertion makes me out of breath. They gave me an albuterol inhaler with 200 doses; I have to keep up with 2 puffs every four hours while I’m awake or I feel shitty again.

I’m hoping to recover soon, and in terms of resources, I’m fine. Emotionally, not good.

First, I’m thinking of who I may have infected. I do a charity food delivery to an older couple with health issues who can’t drive. My last delivery to them, including extra bottles of hand soap, was five days before I started having symptoms. I also got an extra bottle of soap for my neighbor, also an older woman with health issues who can’t drive. I tried to call my neighbor earlier today but she didn’t answer the phone. I’m debating who I should call to check on her since I don’t want to risk going anywhere near her.

Second, all my family is on the other side of the country. The ones who are in my age group are taking this seriously, which is good. My parents though, I’m not sure. They’re concerned for me of course, but overall they just seem irritated about the logistics. I’d already been planning on moving out to be near them. I was going to fly, but now the plan is for my mom to fly out to me, help me pack, then we drive back. They don’t seem to be thinking of the possibility that domestic flights will be cancelled. They’re operating under the assumption that the only people who should worry is elderly people and immunepromised while everyone else will be mildly inconvenienced.

Third, I’m worried about my grandparents. My grandpa is ill and has dementia. He still lives at home and my grandma is his primary caregiver. They are exactly the demographic that’s going to be hit hard by this. Thankfully they have family nearby to check on them, but what if they visit while asymptomatic?

Fourth (and most selfishly) I’m worried about my own health. None of this is a normal way for my body to react to an infection. Research has clearly been showing that some people, even young people without prior health problems, sometimes are having permanent lung damage. If I’m one of those people, how much and how will it affect me later? I don’t know how to talk to my family about it without them thinking it’s my anxiety talking and spend all their time reassuring me when I really just want to vent.

I had a near death experience a decade ago that really changed my perspective on fear of death. I'm pretty sanguine about the fact that I will die at some point and kind of whatever. But...

I have a husband. Kids. Parents and in laws over 65. Family and friends who live all over Asia.

I'm not afraid to die but I am terrified of losing any of these people. I'm not worried for my children's health because the virus seems to spare little ones but what if, God forbid, my husband and I get sick? What if they lose their parents, their grandparents? How do I brace my preschoolers for the possibility of 0anything from ""everybody is fine"" to ""every safe adult in your life is gone suddenly and traumatically""? 

What if the virus doesn't touch us but the economy collapses and people start starving? What if we go to war over resource scarcity? These possibilities scare me even more than the virus. Every time we eat dinner together or do some normal family thing I find myself wondering if we are unknowingly going through the last few normal days our family will ever have. 

A few years ago there was a video circulating that shows a goPro style view of a year in the life of a little girl in a war- torn country. It starts with a normal kid birthday and progresses until her next birthday, dirty and hungry and alone in a refugee camp. It keeps playing over and over in my head but with my own children's faces. 

I know I'm thinking catastrophically and I recognize the feeling of paranoia from previous bouts of anxiety disorder but I don't know how to sort out what is a probable threat from what is wildly unlikely.

2804,"Perspective Shift on Loss of Time As a junior in college, I have certainly been struggling to ovee the hurdle of feeling as though time is being stolen from me. We’re often told our 20’s are the best time in our lives, and that we should enjoy our youth while it lasts. I’m sure that no matter your age, you can relate to this on some level. 

It took me MONTHS toe to this realization, but after sitting with it for the past few days I truly feel so much more at peace. Simply put...

Life is not about the time we are given, it’s about the time that we have.

In my life, I’ve had friends unfortunately pass away far too young, and have consistently been struck by how many of them have lived more in their short time here than some ever will in their lifetime. This has afforded me the opportunity to truly see how “loosing” the next few years does not necessarily condemn us to an unfulfilling, dreadful life.

My suggestion to anyone struggling with this same obstacle is to list out all of the things you’ve aplished in your lifetime that align with your values & desires. Embrace these experiences and feel as much gratitude as possible! Instant mindset shift. Furthermore, write out a list of all the things you would like to aplish once this pandemic is over. Set your intentions for our eventual return to normalcy.

As difficult as it is, I believe this period in our lives will teach us so much more about appreciating the time given to us. Without this pandemic, it’s unlikely that I would’ve thought twice about my morning walks to class, the freedom to travel, nights out with friends. Once this pandemic is over, I think like will be seen with a new richness we would’ve never experienced if this hadn’t happened. And that’s something to be thankful for! The silver lining if you will. 

Disclaimer: I recognize that this pandemic brings up so much more than this obstacle. For many, this is a life-altering, and ultimately life threatening situation. I emphasize with you all but wanted to share my advice to anyone also experiencing these thoughts!",35,0.97,iev36n,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/iev36n/perspective_shift_on_loss_of_time/,4,Firsthand Account,2020-08-23,-4,113,-0.035398230088495575
2805,"This Is What I've Realized I stay inside a lot. Too much.
But inside is where everything is still ""normal"". Nobody's walking around wearing a mask.

The few times I've gone out to ride my bike or walk is very late at night. Because there's hardly anybody out so no people walking around with masks: everything looks ""normal"".

I have never been good with change. There's probably a therapy session or 2 around that but, regardless, I'm just not.

It took me - no lie - 4 years before I didn't feel like 9/11 didn't happen the day before. It was just too fucking .....big. i could not, my brain could not wrap my arms around it. Too big.

Well, this is even worse. 9/11 - as God awful as it was - was finite. The day happened - it was horrific - the days (weeks) following were also no picnic....but it had a beginning and an end.

This, though. Too.Much.Change. All.At.Once.

Can't deal.

I STILL, driving to the supermarket, being in the supermarket, am so unnerved by seeing everybody wearing masks. I get why we are intellectually and I totally support it but it's still SO FUCKING WEIRD to me. My anxiety ratchets.

The other thing I'm not good at all with is not knowing... anything. EVERYTHING is a dangling participle. Human beings in general (I've found) are morefortable knowing than NOT knowing. I'm in the camp of people who have that need for knowing even more strong.

The anxiety that produces makes the other pale inparison.

This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Nothing else touches this. Not even close.

I'm exhausted. I'm an emotional mess.

2806,"Literally the only one in my world taking precautions, feeling defeated and isolated Hi all,

First, want to sent virtual hugs to everyone here. I'm so sorry for the pain, anxiety, frustration, and other feelings going on. You're not alone.

My situation is simple: I'm the only one in my entire family, on either side, that is taking precautions...and it's really starting to get to me. Both of my parents are doctors, countless sibs + cousins are nurses or nursing assistants. My mom is a cancer patient. They are having normal summers, with indoor gatherings, travel (including flights) to and from hot spots, going to bars and restaurants. All without masks. My partner and I have stayed home, except for the grocery store or distance walks, since March. This doesn't give me anxiety, as I accept that I can't control them...but I'm just baffled, disappointed, and very very isolated.

People respect my choices, but behaviorally they demonstrate pity. Like, ""aww, look at how they're letting fear run their lives"". Partner and I have sacrificed so many fun things this year, because we feel a duty to our neighborsmunity. Even though we won't change our plans, frustration persists. Physically, I'm feeling bogged down and tired by this, and I don't see an end to it. Half the time, I'm wondering if my family will be in for a rude awakening later this year, especially my immunopromised mom. 

My partner and I were exposed and I displayed mild symptoms, so we're even moremitted to staying home...but I just can't believe that I'm the only one who believes this disease exists. I do see a therapist for general mental health matters, so thankfully treatment helps some.

I'm really hoping to chat below with anyone who has similar experience? Anyone else the only one staying home, or in the extreme minority in their families doing so?",33,0.94,hxu8wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hxu8wt/literally_the_only_one_in_my_world_taking/,16,Support,2020-07-26,-11,115,-0.09565217391304348
2807,"My dad's anxiety is truly going to be the thing that gets him, not covid, I don't know what to do My father is incredibly concerned about getting COVID 19. He's in his 60s and has asthma. While I believe that he *is* vulnerable and our household should do everything that we can to protect him, I also think that there are some elements of this fear that are going to the extreme and maybe even bing more detrimental to his health than the actual disease ever would be.

Since the beginning, we have been on *extreme* lockdown. Grocery delivery. No seeing friends at all. Not bringing the dog to the dog sitter because there's a teeny chance that he could be a vector too. No takeout food. My dad is the only one to do any kind of errand like getting gas because he believes that he's the only one who can do it safely and correctly. Instead of just waiting for three days to open mail, or opening it and then washing our hands - he waits for three days, opens it, sanitizes it, and then places the product in a UV chamber that he built for another one or two days.

I'm trying to be understanding, I don't want him to be this scared, and I don't want to lose my dad... so my mom and I have just tried to suck it up and be incredibly careful.

This has been really hard for me for a number of reasons, and this is a much longer story, but I don't actually live with my parents. I live overseas with my husband and got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time when all of these things started happening. So I've been in my parents' home. I haven't seen my husband or my friends in months. It's incredibly hard. In this country, I also have friends who want to do things like go on socially distanced walks who I have to say no to because my dad is ufortable. 

I've been in the camp for a while that we need to cater to whoever has the greatest amount of anxiety in the household - my father - and do whatever we can to make them morefortable. However, it's getting to a point - I just made a different post about an appointment that I have if you want to see a specific circumstance, but I'm realizing that my dad's anxiety is a much larger issue.

He has always been depressed and anxious. He doesn't have any friends so not seeing people hasn't been a real issue for him. He hates going to work so working from home hasn't been... bad... but it hasn't made him any happier because he's still depressed.

He's stopped going outside. He goes between the room that he's set up for his office and the room that he sleeps in - he and my mother haven't slept in the same bedroom for my whole life - and onlyes downstairs like twice a day for coffee and food. Prior to this he was on a healthy diet and exercise plan but has since slipped back into eating white bread and drinking soda. He's taking a vitamin D supplement but how good is that really if he refuses to go outdoors at all. 

The amount of stress and anxiety that he has is extreme. He spends most of his weekends laying in bed. There was one week when my mom and I went to our beach house to get away - we did note into contact with anyone, but he still didn't trust us when we came home and made us all wear masks for two weeks. He wouldn't stand in the same room as us and he would literally jump or flinch every time he saw either of us.

Whenever a neighbores by to speak to my mother from a distance, with a mask on, he stands at the window monitoring the situation to make sure that he knows they were at an acceptable distance.

This is the kind of stress that kills you. Yes, I think that if he got COVID he could possibly be severely ill - but not because he was ever predisposed to this disease - but because of his mental state and his physical state that has resulted from it. I know that you can't just stop being like this - I've seen this sort of thing from him for my whole life - but there are literally so many studies about how this affects your immune system. He's acting like he's going to get it, and going to die from it - whereas if he acted like he wasn't going to get it, and wasn't going to die from it, he probably wouldn't! 

Again, I believe that we need to take the precautions that we need to in order to protect him - however, it isn't fair from him to descend into the depths of this mental illness and still govern everything that my mother and I do, as the law only gets more and more extreme to suit the state that he is putting himself in. Instead of getting help or at least taking steps that are proven to improve his condition, like going outside for just 20 minutes a day. He is making himself more vulnerable. Creating the need for us to be more and more careful. It's starting to do in my mental and emotional health as well given that my circumstance hasn't been easy either. 

I don't want to blame him - but you see what I mean? I'm at a total loss. My mother feels like she can't talk to him. I don't feel like I can either. But the level that he's at is dangerous for his health.",35,0.97,hhy1zx,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hhy1zx/my_dads_anxiety_is_truly_going_to_be_the_thing/,15,Support,2020-06-30,-20,240,-0.08333333333333333
2808,"Does anyone else have anxiety in going out in public not due to fear of the virus, but because of how they've seen their fellowmunity members react? I live in a very conservative part of the USA that has not been hit very hard with regards to the virus.  Still, we've been in lock down mode since end of March... I've been working from home and having groceries delivered.  They are now just starting to remove the lock down guidelines and re-open restaurants, etc., like much of the USA.  I would love to get out there and start interacting more... I'm at a slightly higher risk due to asthma, but with distancing guidelines and mask wearing I would feel ok hiking or going to a store... still notfortable eating inside a restaurant and definitely won't be flying anywhere soon.  However, I have seen the reactions from my neighbors andmunity members and I feel no desire to want to get out and interact among them.  I've seen thements left under our local news posts, under the Neighborhood apps, etc., and it really upsets me.  These are the type of posts that aren't just expressing doubt about the science behind the pandemic... while those make me roll my eyes that wouldn't stop me from leaving my house... but there was so much vitriol on these posts against people who supported the lock down or even just supported wearing masks.  Lots ofments along the lines of not caring if elderly orpromised people die, etc.  I've always known my values haven't always matched the values of mymunity members, and that has been ok as I feel like I'm making a difference from within, but the sheer number of brutal, no empathy, laughing-at-your-painments is frightening.  Every time I go for a walk now I feel like I am watching my neighbors at the park with a suspicious eye... ""Is that nice looking lady who is laughing at her child playing the one that couldn't care less if I died tomorrow?"" ""Is that man the one that stated we need to reopen everything tomorrow and only have the elderlypromised stay home, even if their job requires they return to work?"" It's just easier to cocoon myself in my house this summer and not interact with the general public at all.  However, I have to physically return to work on June 15th, and quite honestly, am dreading it.  The area of the country I live in was making strides towards letting others know that racist and homophobic statements are no longer acceptable, so it seems like those who hold those views are now expressing their hateful thoughts through the pandemic... and it is accepted as fine to do so.  It has be evident even through mask wearing... hardly anyone in my town wears them, and I and two of my friends have noticed on separate occasions how hostile people are in person when they see you wearing a mask.  Is anyone else anxious about going out not because of the pandemic, but because of how hateful their localmunity has been towards those that are being cautious?

Because I had that realization that had been nagging at me constantly and struck when at my most vulnerable:

This is what my life has be;  A retreat further into routine.

Ever since the pandemic, this has been my one coping mechanism against something that's not only beyond my control but has such an omnipresent influence on behaviour and how things operate.

Not that it wasn't the case earlier.  The difference being I had social outlets to flex my inner extrovert and could look forward to enriching my mental health and creativity just by being around people, supporting them, making my mark.

Now, without those outlets, I'm as ridged as theye.  Constantly looking over my shoulder whenever stepping out into the world for something as simple as a trip to the supermarket.  Wary of that sly Covid monster lurking in espionage.  

It's even affected my writing in some ways.  So afraid that I'll never achieve full exposure, worried about losing my ability to create should I catch it, that I'm rushing things instead of taking the time for it to organically develope.  Missing details, making more mistakes I fail to catch.

It's like there are always people here that care for each and every person that posts on here looking for support for anything that is going on in their lives.

I'll tell someone I am sad when really I am upset and feeling broken. I dont make things seem like a big deal when in reality I should be more open and for some reason I feel open on here.

We have no positive cases but my husband works in a prison that has over 800 positives. He found out Friday night that he had worked with someone Tuesday who tested positive Thursday or Friday. I called in to work so I could talk with the head of infectious disease control, they told me as long as I'm not symptomatic and wearing a mask I can go in. That didn't feel right to me so I contacted the department of health for the state and they said I could still go in.

My husband gets tested tomorrow and will get his results in a day or two. I talked with a few family members and realized I couldn't go in there knowing there's a chance my husband could be carrying it. He cant quarantine to a different room as our home is too small, plus we have a child, and we share a car. We don't need the money I was bringing in so my family will be ok but I feel awful for my coworkers still going in. Especially since they are needing to fill my spot. But I'm worried about being the one to bring it in our facility. 

There's a few people who actually care about their job and the people there but most don't. Honestly this place has a reputation in our town of being awful. And working there, I've seen and heard things first hand that I've encouraged residents to contact the state about. I hate the place but I really care for the residents.

I'm worried how this will effect my chance of another job since this is my first one since my son was born. I've worked there for less than three months and they could fire me for anything.

Basically I feel torn. I don't want to bring it in, but I know nurses or CNAs could bring it also. I can't live with guilt if my husband ends up testing positive and I went in. I feel like I abandoned everyone and I'm just being selfish. I feel like maybe I'm overreacting but because of my anxiety I can't see that. I'm confused and don't know what to do.

2822,"Dropped out of a wedding I had to drop out of a wedding that I was in the party for. I feel like I’m crazy! They are having the wedding in June (pushed back from May), and I told her I can’t go unless there is a giant change in the world. My biggest fear is to catch this thing and maybe pass it to someone else. My boyfriend is also newly diagnosed with Diabetes type 1 and he’s “kind of” immunpromised... according to his doctor. She understood but I am still in all the group chats and get notifications of the bachelorette party and bridal shower. I feel so guilty because I am not going to be apart of it. I also find myself getting angry because she won’t wait to get married. It’s her and her fiancée choice, but I think it’s crazy. Most of the bridal party has dropped out and there are going to be masks and gloves as well as a temperature check at the door. 

I think I just need feedback that I’m not absolutely insane for backing out. I see friends hanging out all the time and my parents even hang out with friends at their house. My aunt is a nurse and she’s still showing us that this isn’t a joke.

But, there is envy too. Only a handful of people I know are still physically going into work. About 80% of my job could be done from home, but here I am, in the office every day. My phone blows up around noon with friends wanting to talk, chat, game, etc. I'm envious of them. My selfish little introvert inner voice is frustrated that we don't get to be at home too.

I'm behind on housework because it's so stressful at work that Ie home and just disassociate for a while.

A few friends even pointed out that I'm checking in less, posting on social media less, and generally being distant. Yeah, damn right I am. Work is nuts, stressful and I'm constantly fighting the desire to throw my hands up and work from home. But, that 20% of my job I can't do from home is crucial to multiple departments success, so going home would be ultimately selfish and only serve to make things harder on everyone (including myself).

I just feel so torn. I want to go home. I want to be selfish. Yet, here I am, at work, in the office, on a skeleton crew to keep things rolling.

Our neighbors hosted a pool party last night. There are always cars at their house. On fb, one of the parents of this family posted a video of some guy talking about how the encouragement to stay home is most likely due to the gov't wanting to control us and not so much about stopping the spread of a pandemic. Of course, plenty of facts, in the form of soundbites out of context, were used to back up his point. And the next day they throw a party at their house with multiple families. I'm so frustrated by this for several reasons. Selfishly, it bummed my daughter out, because she is in a family who is following the rules but she deeply misses her friends and it's been hard for her. But more than that, I am scared of what is going to happen to ourmunity. Our governor is one of a few states not to declare shelter in place. We have great local leadership, but that can only go so far, and I worry for our ruralmunities. My father is still working, and he's over 66.

2840,"Toxic unsafe office 


I'm at my wit's end and really depressed over this and am glad I stumbled on this sub. I work in a small rural law office in NC. Telmuting is not possible--it's an old school office with lots of paper. The building is very narrow and social distancing is impossible. But the NC Governor has a mask mandate in place. Our office has the front door locked to the public and a sign saying anyone with an appointment must wear a mask. BUT, NONE of the employees wear masks or social distance among each other. In fact, my boss gets irate and downright angry at the mere mention of a mask. Yet he loves to stand directly over me to talk for long periods of time (and sneeze/cough). We also have a covid positive employee who is currently home quarantining. He never told the office why he was home so no one knew until the local court clerk called to verify a rumor that this person had covid!!

  


Meanwhile, the first time I tried wearing a mask at my desk before we had a positive, my boss had a fit, said he couldn't understand me, and insisted I remove it. So I had to put my personal concerns aside andply. This past week with a confirmed positive and another employee who is home very ill with covid symptoms (but had a test--negative, but she still may have it and should be retested), I came to work this past Monday with a mask on. I told the firm I intended to wear one going forward since covid has now reached our office--what's the difference between making the ""public"" wear masks but none of the employees do? Makes no sense. Anyway, when my boss saw me he was furious again. I got a 40 minute lecture on how it's all nonsense, masks do nothing (yet the firm has a mask sign on the door), he'sfully prepared to get covid--if it happens, it happens, etc. Basically, classic gaslighting and bullying. We finally agreed to disagree and he's trying to now deal with me wearing a mask. Prior to covid, he and I had a great relationship and I loved my job. Now I feel unsafe, am the only employee wearing a mask (and am the oddball), and never know when my boss is going to blow again, or when someone else will turn up positive and the office will keep it quiet and stay open. Our County has a big uptick going on.

  


I'm looking for virtual employment , and can't really afford to quit this job until I find something else. Am I overreacting like my boss thinks? Do I continue to stick it out, putting myself and my husband (high risk) at risk, or just cut my losses and go? I think I'm only there now bc I used to love and respect my boss and I like the work. But now I feel the damage has been done emotionally, I walk on eggshells not knowing when he's going to blow up again over my mask, and the risk is ever-present with all their stupidity and naiveté.

2842,"Feeling Worse Even Though Society is Starting to Reopen? Is it weird that I almost feel worse than I did during quarantine now that we’re reopening? My state is one of the few in the USA that is doing pretty well and has a relatively low virus count right now. So we’re continuing to reopen.

Before Covid, I was a super busy college student. I left my apartment at 8AM every morning and didn’t get home until about 8 or 9PM. I usually got at least 2 hours of physical activity a day, and managed to hang out with friends on top of it all. But now, it feels like I can’t even go for a run without being exhausted the rest of the day. A trip to the store leaves mepletely drained.

It’s almost like I’m more depressed now than I was back when we were in full-on quarantine. Back in March and April, I couldn’t wait until everything opened back up. But now I just have no ambition for anything. My state is in a place where I could see a friend or two, outside and sitting 6 feet apart. But it’s like I don’t even want to anymore. It honestly just doesn’t feel worth it. My parents offered to take me back to my college apartment to get some of the things I left there back in March, but I don’t really see the point in it. I haven’t spoken to my friends in about 3 weeks, because it doesn’t feel like there’s anything to talk about anymore. I basically force myself to go for a walk or out on a drive once a day, just to get myself out of the house, but even that feels like a huge chore now.

Around February, I also started talking to someone online in another country, who is my dream girl, who is 29.

However, being stuck in lockdown (in the US) since March has taken a massive toll on my mental health. Suddenly, all my hopes and expectations were destroyed, and I feel like me (as well as her), we're going to spend the rest of our 20s locked up, and it's causing daily anxiety and depression. I realize how short life is, and I'm starting to question why I spent so many years working, being responsible, saving money rather than traveling, and earning money, instead of spending time with SO, friends, family.

People keep saying, oh, I'll resume xyz when ""corona ends"", as if it's a temporary thing. People seem to be in denial of the fact that there's no reason this wouldn't last 2, 3, 5+ years. Sure, lockdowns will loosen then start up again when waves hit again. But things won't go back to the same for years. To me, this seems to be the new world order.

2844,"Social Distancing Forever? I struggle with severe depression and anxiety. I did even before this whole thing started. Obviously, this has not helped.

I'm just in a really bad place and struggling with this whole thing. In particular, I have lately been struggling with the idea of social distancing lasting forever. I'm not a terribly social person but the idea of never being able to get within six feet of someone outside my household is making me incredibly depressed and anxious. Zoom meetings don't replace the real thing for me. Neither does talking to people six feet apart with masks on. I get that those things are necessary right now. But they actually make my depression worse.

I've been trying to avoid the news as well because that doesn't help my anxiety. Though it's often impossible because I live with my dad and he pretty much always has the news on. So early this morning I overheard a news report in which the mayor of I believe Newark NJ was quoted by the reporter as saying something like we need to live with this new normal because the old pre-COVID normal is nevering back.

So obviously, this immediately got to me since I've been fearing this. I don't live in or even anywhere near Newark NJ. I live in a different east coast state. But hearing this from an elected official made this feel more real. Like maybe it's not just my anxiety talking and we really are going to have to distance forever.

I'm in my early 20s. And in a way, hearing that we may never be able to stop social distancing, I just don't know what to do. I know it's necessary right now but there's no way I can do this forever. If this really is the ""new normal"", I just don't think I can do it. People say stuff like ""this too shall pass"" but honestly it's hard to see that. As I said, I'm not terribly social. But I'm not sure I can live in a world where I will never be able to have basic human interaction again, with anyone outside my immediate family. And I definitely don't want to. But it makes me feel in a way like my life is over before it's really begun. I just don't see the point of anything anymore.

It was unexpected. My grandpa and I grabbed our masks and put them on and I asked him if he wanted to talk to her through the door (glass) and he said no. I told him letting her in wasn't safe but he didn't want to talk to her through the door. 

I left it up to him and part of me wanted to see her too because we have been isolation for so fucking long now. Only going to the grocery store. I have even put stuff off because I have had drainage at night that made my throat sore and gave me a cough. My hands are so dry from washing and using hand sanitizer... And I'm lonely. I've only been texting my fiance. I just desperately need interaction outside of a damn phone. 

I went to the bathroom and when I came back, she was sitting on the couch, keeping distance from grandpa and she was wearing a mask. We all were. 

I sat down across the room but then decided to move everyone outside because it was a nice day and it is safer. I read about how air flow disperses any droplets and makes it harder to get enough viral load to be infected. 

We enjoyed the visit from my mom and I honestly feel like it improved my mental health a bit (I've had severe depression), but now I feel bad because I broke quarantine by letting her in... 

I posted here before about giving up social distancing because no one else in my county is doing it at all (or masks). I feel like cattle when shopping because people just gather around me without a care. 

I will still wear my mask, but honestly, if I'm going to get Covid (likely) I want to get if from people I give a shit about. I just don't want to make others sick by not at the very least wearing a mask. I can't really help if they get close to me, though. They're making their own choice.

2847,"Positive Covid Symptoms and Scared Hi all, essential employee here. Today started out like any other normal day. I hit snooze way too many times, but 5ames early! I was very sluggish this morning, but attributed it to my dog waking me up at 11pm last night because of a storm. While letting my dogs out, I started coughing, ended up gagging and throwing up. I decided to take my temperature as a precaution, only to realize I was running a low grade fever. I notified my job, and they advised me to take the day off.

As the day went on, I couldn’t shake the fever, and finally gave in and called a tale-healthpany my health insurance offers. After going over my symptoms they advised that I have mild Covid symptoms and would need to quarantine for 14 days. They told me to put a call in to my primary doctor to keep them in the loop. Upon doing such, I was told that because I was young and healthy I probably wouldn’t be tested. After going over my symptoms I was instructed that I needed to video chat with another doctor in their office that handles all possible Covid cases. I had my video chat, went over my symptoms again, but was told that unless my fever spikes or I start experiencing respiratory distress, I don’t qualify for testing.

My fever is staying the same (99.1), as well as most of my other symptoms. My chest has started hurting, but I think that’s from coughing. The only new symptoms I have are loss of taste/smells. I haven’t experienced aplete loss, everything just seems muted. Some things I can’t taste/smell at all, while others are faintly experienced. All of this started this morning, 15 hours ago, and I’m just scared.

So far, I can still smell things.  But because I've been to Rite Aid to pick up my drugs there last Saturday, I constantly have to smell and taste everything in my house to make sure that I didn't develop the coronavirus, since I don't have any way to test for it right now.

Symptoms develop within the next two days to two weeks, and I'm fighting to make sure I retained everything about myself after that trip to Rite Aid to pick up my drugs and toiletries.  And I'm doing this so obsessively that I can't enjoy anything else I used to enjoy in the past!

2850,"I don't have any special reason to worry but I am basically incapacitated. And ashamed about it. I'm a 45 yo guy, mildly overweight and a former smoker plus an alcoholic who quit 3.5 years ago but with a long history of taking very good care of myself (diet and exercise). Though I've had a tough couple years due to divorce/custody that have taken an extreme toll on me stress-wise. Blood pressure basically normal. Went for a run today, etc. And, ironically, the current social distancing has allowed me to catch up on a multi-year backlog of sleep, which is probably good for my health. 

The problem is that I have a long, old history ofplex PTSD mostly involving avoidance. So when I can't meet responsibilities or give a good answer for why I'm failing to deliver on a work obligation, I freeze up and I just stop reading my email or turn off my phone. Under normal circumstances, I have pretty much had this under control for a few years now, but now its gone bananas. 

I havent read email in a few days and have my phone on airplane mode. Bear with me, I realize how totally bizarre this probably sounds to a normal person. 

I understand that my ""odds"" of surviving the pandemic are approximately 99.6. I understand that even the pretty smart calculator I used to do this didnt factor in many ofthe proactive things that I am doing. I understand that this will probably all be OK. 

But.

The thing is. I am the sole custodian of a 6 yo boy. And he is the most precious, beautiful, forever wonderful thingt that ever came into my life. And he needs me so much. And I can do some CBT and walk through a worse case scenario where I get unlucky and die but he ends up OK. But I simply cannot bear the thought of the loss, for him mostly, and just slightly less for me. 

And so I simply freeze. I can't stand it. 

And I feel guilty posting this here where there are other very real people already dealing with horrific losses of loved ones. And I am truly so f-cking sorry for you that it makes my heart hurt. Please forgive me if I seem selfish in the light of your own real loss.

2858,"I'm just so sad about everything. The past few days have been really hard. It has been so hard to fight the tears back, and I feel like I want to cry almost constantly. I know letting it out is a good thing, but I can't just cry for days. I am so sad for my son. He is 10 and we are doing online school this year. He was also in scouts since first grade, and I was/am his den leader.

Since March, we have been taking every precaution possible to not get this. I am in a higher risk category, and a single parent. If I were to get this and have to go to the hospital, I don't know who would take care of my son, especially considering he would most likely have it too. I have family in the area, but most of them are over 60, and I couldn't risk them getting it too. 

Scouting has been a big part of our lives for the past 5 years, and just recently we have started up the new year after a hiatus since March. We had one meeting in person, and there were about 20 people there total. The kids were all wearing masks, but it was impossible to keep them a safe distance from each other. I also learned that there is at least one other kid in my sons den that is going to school full time, in a district that is being investigated by the health department because (at least 3) parents have been sending their children to school after testing positive.

After learning this and seeing how the meeting went, I made the very hard decision to stop being the leader this year and only continue scouting from home. This was the only time since March that my son has seen any of his friends more than just dropping things off at each other's houses/waving from the car. He has been having zoom meetings with his friends, but it's just not the same as getting to play in person. 

My son has said he is sad about it, but also that he doesn't feel that much emotion about it (his words.) It is just breaking my heart that this is hurting him, and I just feel so bad that he has to go through this. I'm just so, so incredibly sad about the whole thing right now. I know that this will be over some day, but it is so hard to see that light at the end of the tunnel when we don't even know if we are half way through yet.

I keep trying to look forward for the vaccine, but there is no real timeline of when it will be available for everyone. I want things to go back to normal. I want my son to get to play with his friends. I want to see my family again. I want to quit wearing masks. I want to go to scout meetings and teach the kids.

The literal CDC said it's not safe to go back to school and reversed their guidelines and encouraged schools opening within a week. I'm just so lost on what to believe.

It's not too big of a deal to continue doing disinfecting but it does bring me a great deal of stress every week. I open the groceries on the porch so it's hot, my neighbors stare at me, I dread it.

2864,"It sucks that the physical symptoms of anxiety can resemble covid Headaches, lump in the throat, fatigue, a tightness in the chest. Is it anxiety or covid? The only way to tell is a test.

But getting a test means self isolating away from loved ones and anxiously waiting for my results for up to 3 days. My country has only a few cases, so it is probably nothing, but there is a small chance that it could be bad. My partner works in healthcare so I can't take that risk.

I have had issues in the past with health anxiety, but my coping strategy was to not give my anxious thoughts any power and just keep going about my day. Now whenever I have a symptom, I have that dilemma of ""Do I need to get a test or do I just need to calm down?"". My old coping mechanisms don't work anymore. I have to listen to my anxious thoughts, my ""what if?""s have power over me now.  I find myself constantly analysing the way my body feels, my breathing, my throat and my lungs, searching for something that could a sign of covid.

I got a test today. It's probably nothing, but who knows.

Is there anyone else with health anxiety out there feeling the way I feel? I can't keep panicking over every minor sympom my body feels, but if I don't there is a risk of someone getting hurt.

I don't even want to talk to anyone anymore because my depression and anxiety are off the charts. 

My mom is 79 so I am delivering food to her but she is not thankful nor realizes that her favorite foods or supplies are not available now. Sheplains if I can't get her what she wants. Then she wants me to stay and hang out with her because she is lonely (we both wear masks). She also wants to buy a new car now during safer at home, even though she is getting dementia and shouldn't be driving anymore. She is totally irrational, difficult, and can't be reasoned with. 

My sister is a single mother and decided now to start dating someone during quarantine. She has been so careful this whole time not going out but now her caution went out the door when she met this new guy. Now she wants me to babysit my niece all the time while she goes on dates. There is no father in the picture and my sister said she can't get a babysitter because of the quarantine. 🙄 Not only is she risking her health but my niece's as well. Her rationale is that he's been home too so he's not a risk. 

I am furloughed from work but my boss is giving us guilt trips if we don'te in and help her clean (for free) and get the place ready for when we open again. It's one of those ""we're like a family here"" businesses so she thinks we owe her. She only cares about reopening and not about the potential risks and how it's affecting everyone else. I really don't even want to go back to work and I've really enjoyed being off because it's such a toxic place but I feel like I have no choice but to go back because of the job market. Plus we deal with the public so I will have to wear a mask for 8 hours and risk getting infected by being around co-workers and clients. So far I haven'te in to help so I am getting the silent treatment now from her. 

Basically I feel like all I have in my life are manipulative narcissists who constantly take from me and have no empathy as to how this pandemic is affecting me or the rest of the world.

You're not helping CNN. Look I made myself clear early on and recently that I support the social distancing measures and I don't believe in the other extremist ala it's just the flu bro. 

There will be a second wave I don't doubt it but I wish people would understand nuances and stopparing this to the Spanish Flu. Although some historians have disputed reasons why the Spanish Flu was deadly during the second wave some have theorized that because of the nature of the First World War. Those who had the mild strain stayed in the trenches while the more severely ill were sent to crowded trains to hospital ships and thus they spread the more deadly strain of Spanish Flu. 

Unless Covid19 mutates which yes it is mutating but that is natural for viruses and coronaviruses tend to mutate far slower and though while nothing is guaranteed, based on what I have been reading from r/covid19 it is very unlikely to mutate in the way that doomers are hoping. Again it could happen.

I'm so amazed that we have two narratives in this crisis, either the pessimistic, ""we're all dead the second wave will kill us"" vs the ""it's a hoax, muh 5G"".

It has been tormenting me because I never feel like I can relax. Keeping a mental list of all of the things in the house that are ""contaminated"", constantly washing my hands or showering, and constantly changing into clean sets of clothes is exhausting and is making me miserable.

He says that it will take another year for things to go back to normal. Vaccinees out late 2020, but another year to get people vaccinated. Cool! 

Another year of no concerts, no movies, no dining in restaurants, no gyms, no vacations, no seeing our loved ones. Christ. I’m only 25 but I feel so robbed for my parents.

2884,"Phase 3 Trial Like so many others, I am doing the best I can under the current circumstances. I reside in the state with the largest total cases in the country with the most total cases.  It has not been fun. A number of avenues that I have used before with regards to travel have been turned upside down, especially flying/renting cars/hotels.  So I am just doing the best I can.  I'm very fortunate that my family is thriving in so many ways.  Money is good, and the area that I reside in appears to be getting the cases crunched down quite a bit. I feel support all around me. 

That hasn't stopped Health Anxiety creeping up on me in almost daily fashion. Clearly, we are going to have a boom in mental health issues in the USA, some of which is already starting to get documented. I have never had any anxiety issues previous to the pandemic. However, when the health of us and our loved ones feels threatened on the daily, stress is going to surge.  I know I've felt it.  For instance, I've had significant allergies since the spring, causing numerous headaches, and random aches. I've had GI issues.  Flight or Fight has kicked in numerous times. I've suffered the first 2 panic attacks of my life, and I've dealt with numbness in my hands and feet off and on for the past two months. All symptoms that relate back to anxiety.  I've been tested for Covid-19 three times, and my antibodies twice.  Health Anxiety is just brutal.  It makes you push the boundaries of your existence. 

In order to fight back against the stress, I decided to enroll in a Covid-19 vaccine trial. In so many ways, it came down to facing my fear. That's never easy, but I just felt that it was an opportunity to get ahead of things.  I was accepted in late July, and after a 4-hour process that included the nasal swab and plenty of blood collected, I was potentially vaccinated.  It is a blind study, with half of the 30k volunteers getting the vaccine and the other half getting a placebo.  I am sure everyone on this board has read about the studies.  Despite my strong efforts to be nosey and investigate which category I reside in, I got nowhere.  Credit the medical group staff for being stone-faced :) 

The fact of the matter is that the only ones in the study who know that information are the vaccinator and theputer.  None of the nurses you interact with know who is dosed. Since I was a very early participant, and this study is going at ""warp speed"", I would think they'd want to get it out there in volunteers as quickly as possible.  But that's just a guess.  You can make the argument just as easily that they also want to stay balanced as they roll out the trial.

The decision to enroll has certainly caused my anxiety to elevate.  The last thing you want is a larger mystery and additional symptoms.  My symptoms after the initial injection in late July were pretty mild; my allergies were very, very strong the day after (mostly in my eyes), and about 3 days after, my arm (bicep) was sore (like dead arm).  I took an Aleve-D to handle the allergies, which worked great. However, I couldn't really lift anything with my left arm. At the same time, I also never needed any pain meds for it. It was just a sore arm.  

So vaccine or placebo? Tough to know. The placebo effect is very real. I am still 50-50 whether I got the vaccine. The second injection, which is known as the booster, is approaching quick - less than 2 weeks away. I am nervous about that one of course, because it's been said by some in previous studies that the first injection is basically the primer, and the second one is the one that revs up your immune system. So if you are going to feel some side effects, it's the second dose.  I have already scheduled time off the week after this injection, bracing for the downturn.  Since the study is blind, the results (blood work, vaccinated or not) will not be told to me for quite sometime.  I am planning to somewhat circumvent the blind system a bit, and thus get my antibodies individually tested soon. It would be very telling if after the first injection I have developed antibodies.  It would also be telling if I had none. 

Anyway, I just felt like reaching out and kind of explaining what its like to volunteer. We all need some support, and in a lot of ways, we are all likely to progress towards taking a vaccine.  I know the national polls say that a number of Americans will not take a vaccine. But that's because of the current unknowns, which is more than understandable.  I expect the CDC to begin to push back against the negativity surrounding vaccination as well. 

If you are anti-vaccination, I have no bone to pick with you. If you are pro-vaccination, I hold the same opinion. I just made this decision to try and get ahead of the stress and to feel productive. As more information gets out there on the Covid-19 vaccine, and one of the candidates surfaces as the top option with the lowest side effects, I believe the national reluctance will drop.",31,1,i9o4d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i9o4d8/phase_3_trial/,18,Questions,2020-08-15,-20,296,-0.06756756756756757

So at this point we were very worried. He quickly recovered fever but had no appetite. 

But then my 6mos old had a fever 102.7 degrees. We all loaded up and went to the pediatrician and was told both kids had good heart and lung sounds and to wait for a test. 

6days from testing we got a negative result.

2887,"A coworker died and now I'm panicking again CW: Suicidal Ideation

Today I learned that a coworker that I had occasional contact with (months and months) ago passed away from COVID19. Work has had a significant amount of cases, but it's an essential job that can't go WFH. Initially people weren't taking this seriously but since thepany implemented mandatory masks it seems like they've finally started accepting it as a real thing. For me, it's sent me spiraling.

I've been having major anxiety over the pandemic for months now on and off, and I was one of the first ones to carry hand sanitizer with me and put a mask on, though I wish I was better about using it and mask hygiene if I'm honest. I'm 32 years old, but I'm extremely overweight and I might have underlying issues with heart and kidney (I don't know for certain, I can't go to a doctor and check). I'm pretty high risk, and even if I survive getting it my finances are such that even if I just need to take a test the $200 cost and the days off waiting for the results might mean I don't make rent, let alone if I actually catch it or worse yet end up having to go to a hospital.

Today, I saw my friend for the first time in 3 months, since I'm visiting my sister. She hasnt been out of the house really except to pick up her roommate up from the airport, which I didnt know about till she told me about it at the restaurant. 

But, I wore my mask when the waiter was out, and if I wasnt I didn't say anything to her. I didnt wear it in the car, cause there was no point. I didnt wash anything down with a wipe when we got our ice-cream. But I did put on hand sanitizer, several times and wore a mask when I was in the restaurant or when I first walked in rather.  When I got back to my sisters, I washed my hands. 

Other than that, I havent gone to much places. I went inside a restaurant Saturday where my sister's friends graduation party was but I wasn't in there long and I didnt touch anything and I was not really in close distance with many people, I did put on a mask when I realized I was in an indoor  restaurant.

2896,"Anxiety through the roof, no one around me seems to think this is a big deal. I have been feeling more and more anxious the past couple days as I watch the number of confirmed cases rise. I live in Wisconsin, and we are now just starting to get some confirmed cases, but I don't think they are testing anyone here that hasn't been traveling.

I have also been sick the past few days with a really bad cough. It started last friday, got really bad saturday and sunday, then I went to the doctor on monday. They didn't mention anything about traveling, didn't give me a mask to wear, nothing. This felt like a couple years ago when I got bronchitis. I haven't had a fever at all, so I don't think I have covid, but I don't really know. I tried calling my old doctor to just call in the same inhaler prescription I got the last time, but they wouldn't do it without seeing me. That doc stopped taking my insurance, so I had to find a new one, and the new one gave me the inhaler, plus steroids and antibiotics. I haven't taken the steroids or antibiotics because I am afraid of the side affects of the steroids, and I don't think this is bacterial. And besides that, I have been feeling much better since using the inhaler.

I'm so scared, because if this cough isn't covid, what would happen to me if I did get it. I have been a smoker for 20 years and I am overweight. I know I need to get healthy, but this is where I am right now. 

I work from home, so I can stay home for that. I am stocked up to last a month. But, my son goes to public school. I am very, very tempted to just keep him home. There has just been a confirmed case the next county over from me, but I live in the biggest city in the state. I am almost sure it has to already be here, we just don't know it yet. 

What makes it worse, is that I have tried talking to my family about it, and none of them seem to think it's a big deal at all. My mom is in her late 60's and has asthma (lives in a different state,) and my dad is 70 and honestly pretty damn healthy, lives in the county next to mine with the confirmed case. My mom is taking more precautions and at least hand washing and stuff, but my dad just thinks ""oh it's another flu, the news is just fear mongering and blowing things out of proportion."" His sister also just died in California, not covid that I know of, and he is supposed to travel there for the funeral at the end of the month. I have been trying to talk him and my aunt out of going, but so far they are just waiting to see.

Maybe I am, but if we don't just start staying home, it is just going to keep spreading.

I was attending my last semester ofmunity college, working near full time and had been moved out of my parents house for about 7 months. Life was good, it was stressful but enjoyable. COVID-19 caused the restaurant I worked at to shut down. It caused my schooling to shut down and go online. I had to move back home. My best friend moved back home. My surgery for my ACL has taken half a year to figure out and still nothing. Unemployment has yet to respond to me after applying in beginning of April when i first heard about everything. My mom lost her business. Now the riots and looting are starting and it's just raising my anxiety that much more. Life has taken a turn very quickly. I'm confused with where I am in life right now but I am keeping faith. If anyone else is going through similar experiences please feel free to share.",28,0.91,gum47z,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gum47z/how_covid19_has_affected_me_please_share_your/,14,Support,2020-06-02,0,69,0
2908,"Working from home is giving me severe anxiety and depression I'm just needing to vent a moment, please bare with me.

So I work a job that is very stressful on the most normal of days - I do customer service via e-mail and phone support for apany that deals with the transportation of parcels. As is probably well known right now, everyone is buying things online and package volumes are higher than even during Christmas time. It's causing severe stress to an already stressful job, and the senders of these packages are oftentimes business owners. Because they're stressed due to the delay of packages thanks to COVID, they end up taking their frustration out on us. The word for today's post is 'stress' clearly.

Back in March, us CSRs were instructed to work from home and we have been ever since. While some people celebrate being able to WFH, I found that as someone with pre-existing anxiety and depression, the cler separation from work and home for me was needed to maintain my mental health. As I began working from home, it only took a few weeks for my anxiety and depression to be out of control - my apartment is extremely tiny, and I share it with my partner and cat. I unfortunately do not have a room I can lock myself in, so my cat ends up distracting me severely as she is quite needy and it messes with my productivity. Furthermore, because I take phone calls all day for my job, I've been told that my WFH arrangement also stresses out my partner as my headset can pick up the slightest noise and he can't behave like he normally does, needing to be quiet. So this arrangement doesn't only affect me but my family.

In a fit of desperation, I spoke to my doctor and she has prescribed me Prozac, which I actually seem to be acclimating to fairly well. However, the side-effects are a bit gnarly and that, along with everything else, is affecting my productivity. 

Working from home with my job has added a whole layer ofplexity that is making me burnout and have breakdowns and depresive episodes in ways I never did when I was in the office. All I want to do is quit my job as I have enough for 3 months worth of bills saved up, but I know it might not be smart as who knows what the job market will look like in the future because of COVID.

Overall, my living situation (and myself) isn't suited for WFH, but my employer is giving me no other choice but to do this. For right now, we have no idea when we'll be back in the office, and that uncertainty is killing me even more. But I know if I quit, I won't get any ongoing unemployment benefits and my money will be gone in three months. My partner has already lost his job because of COVID, and is getting unemployment benefits but they are less than what he was making at his last job.

I am at a loss on what to do. My rational mind says it isn't smart to quit with only 3 months worth of savings under my belt, but I am suffering so tremendously that I'm not sure how long I ccan go on before having a full-on mental breakdown.",30,1,grajwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/grajwk/working_from_home_is_giving_me_severe_anxiety_and/,9,Support,2020-05-27,-13,172,-0.0755813953488372
2909,"Day 49, and the sensation in my home nation Mexico is surreal It's told that Salvador Dalí once visited México, and when going back home, he said that he didn't want to came back ever to México; he wasn'tfortable that one country was more surreal than his paintings and artworks.

Today is the day #49 of quarantine, considering the day that on my workplace they send us home (And for those we can, work from home). However, technically my state Jalisco started to close up schooles, events, etc. since March 17, while at a federal state was to start on March 23.

However, i had to evade social networks a lot, since there's a huge rise on sickening stuff. Medical staff being assaulted, one hospital closed their doors 'cause people assaulted it since ""the medics are killing their families"" (but they say the Covid is a lie). In resume, the ignorance is too damm high!

A lot of people say that coronavirus doesn't exist since they know no one with the dissiease. But when i exampled the failure on that thinking, that on that terms, for me the VIH, Nacrocartels and world hunger didn't  exists since i know no people with VIH, no ""sicarios"" and no friend of mine died from starvation, i was told that was ""the stupidiest thing"". Simply, people want to believe they are right, and everyone else is wrong, even when you put the probes on their eyes.

I'm feeling tired, not 'cause of isolation (i had been somewhat introvert, i don't have a lot of friends, less those ones that go to party 24/7). What is getting me tired, is the lack of respect to others, that want to impose THEIR ideas.

We had been taking turns in my home to get what we need, and attempting to maximize efficiency (For example, i have to go to my workplace physically so i get my paycheck, so i use that to also get food or medicine we might require. At least when i go out, i notice a lot of people actually use face masks, respect the ""Sana Distancia"" so places are less crowded, and so go on on stuff that talks about being a responsible person.

However, days ago my mother went to get seeds and that kind of food since our ""reserves"" where going low... and she was MAD. Really mad! She told us that people at that market aren't trained to keep distance, even some of them where eating the food on place! A lot of failures that speaks about defficient to null training. Nothingpared to the ""Fresko"" (Is something like Walmart), where they even have ""checkpoints"" inside for the fruits and vegetables sections, and they mentioned that each night they sanitize the whole store.

Today a lot of people on my city where manifesting that the state goverment isn't allowing to open theirerces, even taking measures. And i understand them somehow, the boss on our job pawned 2 job trucks and mortgaged his house to be able to pay another month of half wages, since the workplace money reserves got totally empty! However, thements on that post where: ""they have trucks that price over 17,000 usd they aren't starving, sold them and they will eat for a year""... so yes, they are the kind of people that believe anyone who has a better lifestyle don't have rights 'cause they are not poor.

I'm tired that a lot of people is stupid. I understand that the reality is diferent for everyone, that we must know the context to understand... but there's a lot of people that don't want to test the other's shoes, they simply want to believe they know more than a doctor or a scientist 'cause they watched some video on youtube.

On the bright side, while i have somehow a ""low"" number of contacts and friends, almost over 95% of them are actually people that is concius and don't believe bullshit at random. Even those ones who ""minimize"" the pandemic, and believe isn't so bad, still use facemasks and follow rendations, respecting all those that believe.

But is sad to see a huge number of ignorant and dumb people everywhere. And sadly, thats one of the reasons why we have a such bad president today. And sadly, now i can confirm that is 'cause this kind of people why México is still a poor nation with a low quality of life. I understand a lot better why people risk their lifes for a poor but better quality life in the USA.

But well, in theory, in 10 days most stuff will start to work again taking special health measures (Is that, or risk a nationwide civilan war, or at least that's what i belive could happen).

Also, to warm your heart, a local cosplayer form a north state make a song of ""Susana Distancia"" (a character made by federal goverment to teach safe practices on this pandemic).

2910,"Running out of hope... Hey everyone. I've been lurking at subreddits like r/depression and r/self but then came across to this which would probably have more people that can relate to my situation given current events.

A bit of background information. I'm 28 years old, and a bit of a late bloomer graduating from college with my Bachelor's just last year. I had been in college on and off for 8 years due to lifelong depression and anxiety (I was diagnosed with ASD at a young age) that required me to take a part time load during most of my tenure, as well as working a part time job in retail that wore me off. 

The turning point of my life happened right around this time last year, graduating and getting a job in my field. This improved my self-esteem and gave me the confidence to socialize with people more, even going as far as going to conventions and mass gatherings that align with my interests and lifestyle. Meeting new friends that I desperately needed, as challenging as it was at first, cured my depression and I had been the happiest in easily more than 15 years.

Then bam. This pandemic had to happen and all my dreams had to be shattered. All my hopes of finally succeeding in life have gone away, and I've been rotting in my mom's house in self-isolation in the last two months. Which brings this to another goal I had - I had planned on finally moving out and starting my own life by the end of 2021 or 2022. I'm still employed, but who knows how much longer that lasts and I'll have to suffer even longer, because god forbid it takes months or even a year or two before I could land another decent job. Online chats are okay, but they're simply not the same and to be frank I've lost a lot of motivation to even keep tabs on people given this pandemic. 

I appreciate any input you guys could possibly provide, given that a lot of others seem to be in my shoes right now. I fear we'll be physically distancing ourselves, doing everything virtually, and wearing masks everywhere we go forever -- all of these only feed onto my depression and it hurts -- emotionally and physically. I want to see my friends again but it hurts that I can't even plan my future at all.",30,0.95,gnmsq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gnmsq2/running_out_of_hope/,17,Support,2020-05-21,-11,125,-0.088
2911,"Wearing a mask in the grocery store gave me a panic attack and I took it off and now I’m worried and feel like an idiot. I haven’t left the house in a long time other than for fresh air walks. My spouse usually goes grocery shopping, but today I decided to go with and I wore a mask. Halfway through shopping I started to feel like I couldn’t breathe and my heart rate started going through the roof. As I was reaching up to get some cans on a top shelf, I had to take it off because I was spiraling out and felt like I couldn’t breathe. We quickly went to the checkout, paid, and got out quickly.

Now not only did I just realize I can’t wear a mask, which means I can never get out to the store, but I’m worried that I could have caught the virus in that short period of time. Almost everyone I walked by had a mask on, but some didn’t. I immediately sanitized my hands, but I feel like I breathed in contaminated air because I had to take the mask off. 

Does anyone else have panic attacks with the mask on? Is there maybe another type of mask I could try? I was wearing one of those over the ears cloth masks that everyone is making now. When I got home, I tried on an old N95 mask and I couldn’t do that either.

I’m fine with staying inside and just going for walks like I was, but I need to somehow talk myself down from thinking I caught the virus from seven minutes in the grocery store.",31,0.91,g2x0vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g2x0vu/wearing_a_mask_in_the_grocery_store_gave_me_a/,20,Support,2020-04-17,-5,79,-0.06329113924050633
2912,"I need to go grocery shopping, and I am terrified. Can anyone just talk me up for it? Like the title says, I need to go grocery shopping, and I had planned on going tomorrow morning as soon as the store opens. I have posted here before about my anxiety that I have dealt with before any of this started, but with everything going on now, it is just 10 times worse. I've been doing pretty well for the past couple weeks, as I haven't had to go anywhere. I have not been in a store since before the panic buying started, so that's also something that is going to be strange. I don't know how much the shopping experience has changed in the past month.

But, I am running low on some essentials and I have to just bite the bullet and go. I did delivery once, but they don't take my food card, and I can't really afford to grocery shop again not using my food card. Nowhere in my state accepts online ordering for food stamp cards. 

I found an old mask in my basement, really not sure on the quality but it is all I have. I was going to maybe wear a homemade cloth mask over it. I will be taking all the precautions, cleaning everything before ites into the house, changing clothes, etc. I am also going to be leaving my son home alone for the first time ever since I think that would be better than taking him to the store. He is 9, and I definitely think he can handle it and we have talked about it (plus my duplex upstairs neighbor will be home in case of any emergency,) but I'm still nervous about that. 

I guess I just need someone to tell me that it's going to be fine, or talk me up, or something. I am kind of driving myself crazy right now, and I think I am almost more scared of having a panic attack at the store than I am of getting covid. 

Thanks for listening to me vent, any support is appreciated!

EDIT: First off, thank you all so much for the support!! Without you all this probably would have been much worse!

I am back from the store!!! I didn't have a panic attack!! I did feel very anxious a couple times, like on the verge of a panic attack, but with my own little exercises I was able to stave it off. The woman behind me in line really did not get the social distancing thing at all, and wasn't wearing a mask, but I just stood in front of my cart to put at least that much space between us. I feel so much better now that I did it. I stupidly forgot a couple items, but they weren't necessary right now, so I'm good with that. One thing I forgot was butter, but I should have enough to last a while if I try to use it sparingly. No baking with butter for me!

I didn't check my messages until I got home, and I see now that Walmart is accepting EBT food stamps online for store pickup! This is sooo awesome! I will definitely be using this the next time I have to get some groceries, but honestly for now, I am stocked up for about a month again (accept for milk because that only lasts 2 weeks.) I can't thank you all enough, it is almost bringing tears to my eyes right now with how awesome everyone here is. I know it seems really dumb, but this was a huge thing for me, and I am proud of myself that I went today. Proud of myself for grocery shopping - how dumb does that sound!?

2913,"I feel like I am starting to ""grieve"" my (very much alive) stubborn 88 year old mother. I live abroad, in a country currently on locked down, and feel tremendously powerless. I've begged my mother to stay home and, for a while, it seemed that she was listening. However, it hase to my attention that she constantly lies about how often she leaves the house. This was a tremendous shock for me, as I always thought we had a very honest relationship - it honestly broke my heart.

My mother doesn't have any severe health issues aside from high cholestrol levels. However, she shares a house with a long time friend, another elderly lady, who's diabetic. I've tried to make her understand that she's putting her friend's life at risk, but this friend is just as bad, so they are actually enabling each other's behavior. They're both both retired nurses who think they know how to go about their day and still be safe.

It is my understanding that she has been running errands several times a week. She has access to government services that would help her with the groceries, but is apparently too proud to use them. She is also still visiting her sister who, unfortunately, is severely affected by psychosis and, therefore, very likely topletely neglect all precautions, such as hand washing and social distancing. I've attentemped to make suitable arrangements for my aunt, such as having other relatives check on her, but my mother refuses to, in her own words, abandon her sister.

I don't know what to do. I've experienced a wide range of emotions over this, from helplessness to rage, but mostly depression and anxiety. Due to childhood trauma, I  have a history of extreme escapist behavior, which causes me to mentally and emotionally disengage with things that I feel like I can't hold on to. At this stage, I feel like I am disengaging (thus ""grieving"") with my mother - but when I'm not feeling numb, I am panicking about it.

My dad, on the other hand, has been going places and was working in the office up until last Thursday. He's had prostate cancer and is currently on hormones to keep the inoperable shit that's now embedded in his vertebrae from growing. Do these hormones make someone immuno suppressed? And then when I told him I was worried, he said, it's OK, I've lived my life, my affairs are in order, it will be OK. I was like OK but *I* won't be okay!

2917,"COVID Story Update Hey ya'll just a follow up on this post from last week: [

Last I checked in I ended up talking to 3 doctors who wouldn't test me, but a week later I was still coughing and having trouble breathing which was new, so I called one of the doctors back, who said they would only see me if I was tested lol.

My mom found a place where I could get tested with a nasal swab, and it just came back - negative. They gave me a steroid inhaler which has helped my cough tremendously.

&#x200B;

Not an expert here, but it seems like there are 3 possibilities:

a) I got COVID, but since I could not get a tested for 3.5 weeks, it was too late to get results, as my remaining cough was caused my asthma flared up by my irritated lungs.

b) I still have it and the test was a false negative (entirely possible)

c) I had some other virus but now my respiratory system is in a weakened state and I should be super paranoid until I recover fully

I just found out that someone from my work tested positive and we were in the building the same timeframe, I'm not sure if I was exposed.

I suppose the smart thing to assume I am vulnerable. The governor closed all restaurants and everyone is working from home so I suppose it will be easier.

Whenever she wants to go on a drive or to the store, I ask if I can go with her. Whenever I have to go to the store or on a drive, I ask her toe with me. I know this sounds normal, but I’ve caught her internally cringing every once in a while before politely turning me down or asking me not toe, and expressing how relieved she’s been since I joined a book club on Zoom and talking to other people.

This just isn’t healthy, I know. I crave the action of being around people right now, and I’m showing it by latching into the only person I have regular access to. And I don’t know how to improve this situation. 

I’m not really scared of getting dying if I get sick or anything, but I don’t want to hurt any older or sicker people If I wound up catching It and going in public, and Zoom doesn’t count as being “around people” in my opinion. It’s really good at what it it’s meant to do (lets me talk about my interests and school to relevant people) but beyond that.....eh.

Sorry for rambling. I’m just mainly putting this down to put my feelings into words to talk with her later. Thanks for your time, guys.",28,0.95,irgpx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/irgpx9/i_hate_how_clingy_social_distancing_has_made_me/,12,Support,2020-09-13,-3,75,-0.04
2926,"Follow up: My team and I made this simple chatbot that helps to cope with COVID-19 anxiety A while ago I posted about a [chatbot]( that helps with what's been on everyone's minds lately: COVID-19, specifically the coronavirus.

After lots of you mentioned some of the anxiety symptoms can be hard to differentiate from coronavirus related symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations are just 3 examples), we realized it would be useful to write an [article]( topare the symptoms as intense anxiety can, in some cases, cause similar symptoms to COVID-19, creating confusion, often leading to even more anxiety. So we made a list of the symptoms, as well as techniques to help you differentiate between anxiety and the coronavirus.

I know I can't go and be drastic to end my life because I have so many people who support and love me. I just can't stop feeling sad over what's been going on and how life honestly sucks now (aside from being in a relationship of course). 

Each day that passes without a vaccine and having to social distance from everyone really puts me down. All I ever did before was find time to see everyone I cared about and hang out with them somewhere without having to social distance.

I'm just continuing to sink deeper into my sadness that I might being down with depression. Which might seem silly that people might be like ""Oh stop being a baby and enjoy the introvert life!"" Or I don't know something that will make me feel stupid for getting constantly sad over the pandemic.

I shut my business down (a food trailer) last week to self-quarantine after I got some gnarly symptoms which ended up probably being an asthma flare up. I got tested, and the test came back negative. I'm feeling better now.

But, I'm alarmed by how fucking stupid everyone is being. And I'm alarmed at our insane jumps in case count and I'm mortified and depressed over how much death hase about because of this.

These covidiots out here are convinced it's a hoax, it's not real and are celebratory in not wearing masks and following the guidelines. The only thing I can think and feel is that I hope that they're the correct ones in this situation. That I'm the dumbass, I'm overreacting and that this thing will just go away. I want to feel that kind of certainty.

I say all that to say this: given what we know so far about this virus and the projections for it, if these people are wrong all along...then what we're about to experience is one of the darkest times we'll have gone through in living memory. It's going to be a reality that I don't think anyone is prepared to face. And my major fear is that it won't be a slow burn. It's going to drag us like an undertow that you can't escape.

Well official diagnosis is viral pneumonia. Dr is confident its covid and my test results will be back on Monday. They literally rushed me out and gave me orders toe back when it gets worse. I'm so lost and scared. My kids and wife need me but I feel helpless. I can barely stay awake for more than an hour at a time I'm just so exhausted. Right now I'm quarantined in the basement.. I can hear my kids and family but can't see them, its torture.. I just don't know what to expect. 

I've been so incredibly careful but went back to work last week. Even there I always wore an N95, bleached all contact surfaces and kept distance. Most work was all outdoors. All our grocery deliveries have been disinfected before bringing them in the house. So so so careful.

UPDATE!: Got a call yesterday from the same dr with my covid test results. NEGATIVE!! Dr says very unlikely a false negative and no idea what is causing the pneumonia and symptoms. Follow up with PCP. 

Today appointment with PCP who after reading results thinks may be a false negative. The joy is short lived. Woke up today feeling worse and now with some stomach issues and a sore throat. PCP says suck it up and be strong. Call if breathing gets worse or fever gets high.

2940,"Dad is autistic, isolated, politically radicalized, and follows covid-19 medical quackery. He relies on me for cash but I can't reach him physically or intellectually. My elderly parents are divorced and I am supporting both financially. I feel I should count myself lucky for having steady employment in this pandemic, but I'm working on the other side of the world and cannot meet either due to travel restrictions. I am also super lucky and count my blessings every day because so long as I support them and do not attempt to contact my other relatives, they are willing to talk to me  again after cutting off ties when I came out many years ago. I am an only child so its the least I can do. They mean the whole world to me and it pains me to feel I need to talk it out when so many others are struggling harder.

My dad is seriously worrying me. He's been a sucker for get-rich-quick-schemes even before he retired and most of his 'friends' would turn out to be an MLM rep or similar when I eventually figured out who they were, selling him his own dreams. Like many people on the spectrum, he bespletely enthralled by a topic or hobby and will research it endlessly online. Before he was on social media and when I was younger, it was collecting coins, stamps, shotglasses... but since getting on Facebook and Twitter he's gonepletely down the political / conspiracy theorist rabbit hole and cannot be talked out of it.

I won't break the sub's rules by critiquing his beliefs or the articles he sends me dozens of times a day , every day, often very late at night; but they're in the realm of 'my-friend-on-Facebook-knows-a-US-special-forces-member-who-deployed-the-coronavirus-bioweapon-in-Wuhan-and-asked-me-to-forward-this', and 'inhaling-boiling-water-vapor-and-putting-sliced-onions-in-socks-cures-covid19' level of nuttery anyway. Before the pandemic he was an anti-vaxxer. He's also began raving about carrying out violence on people who oppose the groups he's following online - though I'm not terribly concerned because his health is so poor, he'd probably collapse trying to run towards anyone.

I've tried to debate him many, many times before, but he's from a very traditional background and considers himself the patriarch and will not entertain disagreement from someone younger than him.

I've tried to get him to drop the topic and claim that I'd rather not sour our relationship by bringing up politics anymore - and in fact never, ever start the conversation, but that prompts him to bombard me with more and angrier messages.

I've tried ignoring him. He'd stop for a few hours and then message me with links to cat videos and gardening how-tos. I'd respond positively, trying to encourage him, and he'll go straight back to the nuttery.

I've tried telling him to stop messaging me between midnight and 6am. Cue twenty rapid-fire clickbait headlines at 11:55pm.

Its getting to my wits end. When I can finally travel again, I know I will have to make the trip back to see him as well as clean his house and fix up the furniture and appliances - and I know he will be even more insufferable than ever before. I know he is lonely as his side of the family and my mother have cut off ties from him so I've got to help, but feel not just worried for his health in the pandemic, but also emotionally used up and exploited.",29,0.97,ga7ebb,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ga7ebb/dad_is_autistic_isolated_politically_radicalized/,18,NA,2020-04-30,-7,203,-0.034482758620689655

i thought that i was getting my life way back on track after a couple rough quarters but coronavirus hit and i feel like it's sent me back beyond square one. i feel like i've been hit with an entirely new set of traumas that's gonna take me forever to unpack as well. 

i know realistically that this will not last forever. even the worst case scenario projections are admittedly only a small drop of water in the vast pond of history, but these last few weeks have felt like millennia. i have no idea how we're gonna survive months more, if not years, of fighting this.

i'm the type of person that likes to intensively plan out my schedule for days and weeks, if not months, out in advance. part of why this outbreak has been hitting me so hard is that i was planning to get a lot done this year but i'm wondering if i should just sleep for the rest of 2020 because things are truthfully not looking good. i thought that creating a list of things that i wanted to do after quarantine ends would be a good coping mechanism, but it makes it SO much worse for me honestly. and to think i thought this was gonna be a really good year...

my suicidal thoughts have shot through the roof in the last week or so. trying to wean myself off of social media and whatnot but i've been addicted to the internet in some shape way or form since a preteen so i've given up already on that notion. reading all of these news and predictions about it is just making me feel like if these next few years are gonna be a living hell fighting off this virus and its side effects, then its not one that i want to live in. i'm very worried for my friends and family going homeless or sick or both. even the best case scenario has a mass quantity of deaths.

i know that we will most likely not be in 100% lockdown for the next year or two. there's a lot of doomer mentality about the virus that really gets to my head and its hard to filter out. but it seems like even the best case scenario to this virus is still incredibly shitty and i'm dreading its long-term effects. i know that there's no way to really tell what's going to happen. the whole world is holding its breath. but if things are gonna be the way they are for the next year or two than i'm not sure what i'll do. i feel like i'm in limbo. and i know a lot of the world feels this way at the moment, i'm not alone in all of this. but contradictory, i still feel that i'mpletely on my own other than my parents and a few friends. i've struggled with being alone most of my life and the possibility of this going on without any reprieve for the next few years is really getting to my head and i hate it. a lot of coping mechanisms don't seem to work with me for whatever reason too; its super hard to distract myself from topics like this.

I did that, and we have been writing messages back and forth almost every day since then. We just talk about the situation in our respective countries, how we feel about it, what our friends and family think and whatever happens to us throughout the day :)

2956,"Stuck away from home Hello everyone, 

Life changed for everyone in march. 
I was born and live in northern France but never havingplicated relation with my family, i met two people in the UK who over time became my ""other"" family. 

I had a nice routine, once or twice a month visiting them for the week-end or a few days. It's so close with the channel tunnel. 
It was my ""home"", a safe place where i could relax.

Then it stopped. When travel was allowed again for a few weeks this summer, people wanting to go holiday rushed to buy tickets and it was 6-7 times the normal price, i couldn't afford that. 

Then quarantine arrived & i cannot afford due to my job to spend two weeks in UK quarantine just for a visit. 

I kept telling myself ""it'll be over soon; we have been through the worse of it already, it's just a matter of weeks now"". I didn't look at the number or the news. 

When they announced they were closing the France-Belgium border again last week, i just broke down. 
It's far from over...

I'm so tired of being on edge when I do go out in public. I miss the gym. I'm also incredibly frustrated with wearing a mask everywhere I go. Despite what everyone says, I truly can't breathe in the masks and they literally make me sick from not being able to breathe that well in them.

Not to mention, I miss my girlfriend. I've been able to see her and hang out with her, but since she's been back at work, she doesn't want toe close to me because she's deathly afraid of getting me sick. I can't hug her or even hold her hand when she's had a bad day.

2958,"[Vent] A lot of us are feeling hopeless and I wish there was a way to just make it all stop. When will it end? I don't know how much longer I can go. I've been in and out of severe anxiety and depression episodes since March when this all began. I have health anxiety and this is my worst nightmare. 

I am not only scared of myself dying which I am anyway, I am scared for my parents and grandmothers. I see the numbers of dead every day on TV or the news and cry because so many people lost their loved ones. And I am scared we will never go back to how it was, that I will never go back to how it was.

Before this I was supposed to turn my life around, change my major since I didn't want to study the current one, hope to beat my anxiety and start going out more with friends because I lost all of my friends from how anxious and depressed I was. I am 24 for God's sake. I was hoping that maybe I will start dating and find someone.

But now I can't imagine we will ever go back to normal. I am here alone in my four walls and feel so scared and hopeless. Feel like things will never be good again. Like the people will never heal from what happened. When will the vaccinee? When will the hopee, some miracle cure, something to save lives?

2959,"I finally got some closure on my job at Goodwill. Sadly I'm unemployed now. :( I was expected to go back to work in late May or early June but last week I finally got a call from my team leader over at the merce department and he sadly told me that my m position got eliminated. I'm devastated right now. 

I'm going back home to my apartment on Wednesday after nearly 3 months in isolation and away from most people with the exception of my parents and occasionally my aunt and uncle and cousin who haven't been out in public in weeks since the lockdown. 

I just am at a loss of words of what I can do now. I have enough money for now to last me for a while and I'll be contacting the unemployment office again and see if I can get my benefits still since I never got any of my benefits during this entire 3 months of quarantine. 

I want to work again but I don't know what I can do. I'm not as scared of this disease like I was 3 months ago now that we know a lot more about this virus and despite the utter lack of giving a shit by Trump, I am optimistic that a cure will being soon in the near future.

2960,"Has anyone else felt themselves ""change"" over the course of Covid? That's a pretty vague question, isn't it? Let me see if I can explain a bit better.

I've always considered myself to be a fairly intelligent and well-reasoned person. I follow both the politics and world news pretty regularly and have always thought I'd done so in a dispassionate way without letting ideology guide my views and opinions.

When Covid hit I was sent out of the office to work from home on March 10 (where I remain). I read plenty of news from all different sources and I could see that even though I wasn't in an epicenter that this was still a pretty serious situation (I'm in Boston for the record and while it hasn't been NYC levels, we've certainly had our share). 

I didn't - and still haven't - adjusted well to working from home, but as I read and ingested plenty of news, facts, andmentary it was pretty easy for me accept what was going on and why we were taking the precautions we were. When crazy Uncle Jimmy posted the Plandemic video on Facebook it was pretty easy to cut through the bullshit. When nutty Aunt Alice posted about how nobody could tell her to wear a mask because FREEDOM it was pretty easy to say ""Hey, wait a minute. We're doing this because...""

Like I said though, I've always felt myself a level-headed, dispassionate, and objective person. I did not share these opinions, I considered them wrong, but I could kind of sympathize with why someone would buy into them. I didn't have the energy to argue with them but I had no problem stating my own opinion, backing it with facts, and saying ""agree to disagree"".

Fast-forward a few more weeks and I'm afraid I'm getting beyond the point of merely understanding why someone might want to buy into a counter-factual narrative. I can still call BS when something is obviously BS, but I'm starting to find myself reading a little less critically. I catch myself cherry-picking facts to support the narrative I wish were true rather than the one my intellect tells me is true. I'm not articulating anything, spoken or otherwise, at this point but I'm starting to feel myself rolling my eyes and discounting things that I normally wouldn't. When my immunopromised wife says that ""looks like restaurants are opening next week, but I think we're going to wait a bit before heading back out"" I can feel a myself giving a mental eye-roll and thinking e on, everything's fine"".

The short of it all is that I seem to have lost the mental strength to look at the situation objectively and am instead starting to try and fit things into the narrative I want to see rather than the one that exists. Mostly it's internal, I'm not sharing wacky conspiracy stuff on Facebook and I'm not refusing to wear a mask into the grocery store...but that's today. I'm not sure where I'll be two weeks from now.

I'm hoping this is just Covid fatigue and I'll get over it, but I really feel as if I'm losing my ability to think critically about this situation and instead of cutting through the bullshit I'm starting to let it in and before long I'll be believing it. Whatever it is, I don't like the change I'm seeing in myself.",30,1,gz1w0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gz1w0t/has_anyone_else_felt_themselves_change_over_the/,11,Firsthand Account,2020-06-09,2,170,0.011764705882352941

I’m a 26/F registered nurse who has been working pretty much throughout the pandemic. I live alone and haven’t seen my boyfriend and close friends for nearly 10 weeks. Some days it’s easy and some days, such as now as I go to work... is hard.

I’m a huge extrovert and I thrive in social interactions but it’s a bit differentpared to only being able to see patients and colleagues.

I miss my boyfriend so much. He lives at home with his grandpa who is part of the at risk population. We make do with the distance by talking everyday (we’ve always talked everyday anyways) and by videocalling once or twice a week due to his work (he works from home). 

But I feel selfish because it isn’t enough for me. I’m growing more anxious and depressed as time goes by. People say treat this as a long distance relationship and yeah I get it but I have no social interaction outside of work. I just sleep because I’m tired from work and I’m depressed. When I was in a long distance relationship in the past, I had friends and family to spend time with to keep me sane.

I have struggled with mild/moderate depression or just general mental health issues for a few years now. Over the past year I've kinda got a handle on things, to the point they rarely bothered me. Covid haspletely derailed any progress I've made. I'm probably worse off now than I ever was before.

I thrive off a routine of working full time. Luckily I am still employed, but working from home. Sitting in my house 24/7 is driving me insane. My job that I once loved, I absolutely dread now. 

I also am a ""look good, feel good"" person. My appearance/ grooming habits have a huge impact on my mental health (hair/nails). Salons are closed where I am. I'm a month past due for a haircut & I cry practically every time I look in a mirror, as pathetic as it sounds that I'm worrying about my hair during this time.

* 1/2 cup of granulated white sugar

Mix this all together in a bowl. Roll out or smash mixture onto an ungreased baking sheet, cookie pan, jelly-roll pan, or even casserole dish. Score into ""two bite"" pieces.

This June I was set to graduate from college and start working my dream job that I’ve wanted for 6 years. It’s been pushed off three times throughout the 6 years. Life happened 🤷🏻‍♀️ Last year I found out about the program and got in right away. I’ve been kicking ass in school and was ready for clinical rounds. I was going to be a surgical technologist.

Welp the virus was getting worse and worse and the hospitals stopped taking students. We were told hopefully May we can go to clinicals. I’m angry that my plans have been pushed off for who knows how much longer. I was hoping to live with my boyfriend and start living my life. Now it’s all fucked up and I just want to scream and cry. 

Today I’ve been on the verge of tears. I’m just sad that it’s all been out put off again when I was so freaking close. Part of me wants to give up but I know I have to keep chugging along. I just want this whole fiasco of a virus to be done. I know everyone wants it to be over. It feels like there’s going to be no happy ending in the world again.

I feel like every single time I post something on fb along the lines of ""stop shaming people for leaving their house when they can't work from home"" or ""service/arts/entertainment workers whose jobs were just cut have the right to be upset"" someone alwaysments something like ""it's not about you"" or ""people are dying"" or ""it's about society's most vulnerable"". Or ""social distancing may be a long term thing and we'll all just have to adjust"".

Like, um NO. How about you STOP. Unemployment in the USA just reached 20% a few days ago. Do you know how high that is?! During the Recession of 2009 it was 10%. WE'RE DOUBLE THAT!! During the Great Depression it was 24%. We are SO CLOSE TO BEING THERE and if/when retail shops all close WE WILL BE THERE!! Guess what--during the great depression there wasn't a virus going around, but a lot of people died because they KILLED THEMSELVES. Or STARVED TO DEATH. Because they had NO MONEY. But screw anyone who cares about that/them, right?! I mean SCREW THEM.

In what ridiculous opposite land universe are people living paycheck to paycheck, on jobs that don't have paid leave, not considered some of ""the most vulnerable among us""?! This ""the poor must starve so the elderly can live"" bullshit is UNBELIEVABLY inhumane (yes, I know it doesn't just affect the elderly but service/gig workers are still supposed to ""adjust"" to not having jobs anymore). Guess what, Karen, with your cushy white collar 9-to-5 that lets you work from home and gives you health insurance and your husband and kids and pets that give you additional support you get to stay at home with--GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE.

2% of the US population versus 20% of the US population--TEN TIMES AS MANY PEOPLE are at risk of starving to death as will suffocate to death over the next year. And gun to my head? I'd rather suffocate. By far. None of this is to say we shouldn't be concerned about the elderly and immunpromised, we should, but myself and all of my friends are young, healthy, creative gig workers who up to one month ago had beautiful bright futures ahead of them and expected to live a long time. Literally everyone I consider a close friend is, sorry WAS, in food service/arts/entertainment. And everyone, save one person, lost their jobs. I'm lucky. Ie from a line of good, highly educated New York Jewish stock, and though I'm financially independent I have backup if I need it. Most of my friends aren't so lucky. And I worry about them dying, but not from coronavirus. 

For that matter, I don't do well in isolation. At all. I know I'll kill myself if there's a lockdown and I have to live alone in my apartment for more than 3 days--all my roommates are home with their families, and my mom wants me home because she knows I'm like this. But my sister and dad are immunpromised and my sister also has asthma and I've only been social distancing for like 3 days, in Manhattan of all places. I can't risk it. And every time I'm on social media it's people just being MEAN and HATEFUL. The irony is, I know I'll get COVID19. I know I'll survive. Because I'd really be fine with dying and that's how the universe works. I feel so lost. 

I think if one more person says ""people are dying"" to me after I've been sobbing and shaking nonstop for 4 days, I'm gonna slice up my arm. Or hang myself. I'll have plenty of time to refine the plan. Because even when there isn't a pandemic, I think about people I care about dying every single day. It's like a constant thought.

2985,"I hate absolutely everything right now, and I don't understand why people assume 2021 will bring change for the better I'm seeing a therapist, but the depression I am feeling right now overwhelms me.

At the beginning of the pandemic (March/April/beginning of May), my wholepany worked remotely from home. As the situation in my country more or less stabilized, we were informed that if we give notice to HR ahead (for them to arrange safe working conditions), we can startinging back to the office (but it was voluntary).

I was thrilled, because I was going crazy at home. I arranged with my manager that I will work some days of the week in the office, and some from home, to kinda ease myself in. I thought I will feel better once I go back to familiar routine (normal day activities, wearing make-up and nice clothes, just generally not being stuck at home), but... I was wrong.

PRACTICALLY NO ONE ELSE came back to the office. Everyone is just chilling at home, all pleased that they don't have tomute. I don't know how can they stand it for so many months. So instead of feeling better, I feel even worse, because now that I'm going to a weirdly empty office, I feel even more isolated ironically.

I miss office parties and integration outings, that we used to have. I miss talking to people. I miss hugging my mom (she works in medical field so we have little contact in order not to endanger each other). I miss going out to a bar, or just casually shopping. I don't do... anything... right now. Nothing. I don't see people, I don't go places. And this situation is not changing, not getting better. The virus is not going away. Now soon, kids are about to go back to school, and that + uing autumn/winter season... well, I have bad feeling about it. I'm scared it will get worse.

At the same time, I see that various events (e.g. concerts, conventions), are being moved to 2021. Why... do people assume it will get better just because we switch a page in the calendar? People are being idiots, not wearing masks, not ""believing"" in the virus (oh my God...), clearly it's not getting anywhere near the end, so idk why everyone seems to think as soon as this year ends it will just get better.

Not having anything else to do, I really invested myself in my work (i also got a promotion in April, so I consider myself very lucky, in those unstable times, which only makes me more dedicated). And recently, I had a couple of days when I felt unwell, and panicked a bit that I might be getting sick. My first thoughts? That I will let my co-workers down, that I won't fulfill my duties. Logically it seems to me that I should worry about myself, my safety and health, but all I can think of is that if I got sick, I would have remorse regarding letting my job down. It's insane.

I hate everything that is happening now, and everything that I'm feeling. My year's resolution was to lose weight, but now I don't even care, what's the point? No point doing anything anymore.

I guess I just wanted to vent. I don't know what to do with myself.

2986,"Freaking out regularly like I am? A few simple things you can do to help calm and soothe yourself. Hey all,

First, the obvious. This is a traumatic time and it's asking a lot of us, maybe *everything* of us. The constant threat, the fear for loved ones, the anger at others. For me it catches me at night. It really does a number on me. Laying in bed I spiral to every terrible worst case scenarios.

But, with the help of therapy, I havee up with a list that is helping me stay grounded and so I want to share with you in hopes it might provide you some relief too.

Honestly, some of it made me feel awkward and weird at first but don't let it do that to you. And if you are grumpy old cynic like me, the below is all based on science.

Make sure all your senses are alert. Pay attention fully in what you are doing, engaging all your senses. This is how we get OUT of your head and back grounded into the moment.

**Calm and Collect ourselves.**

1. Place your hand, or both, on your heart. Feel the gentle pressure on your heart. The warmth of your own hand has been shown to calm cardiovascular stress. It provides a sense of security andfort, much like a mother holding her baby. Your body doesn't know the difference in the touch so take advantage of this. Notice your breath as you take some deep rhythmic breaths, notice your chest rising and falling.
2. Gently caress your arm or your face. I've seen many people do this subconsciously and I get why now. It's soothing and shows love and care towards yourself. We all need that, *particularly* if we feel isolated. Don't think, just notice how your touch feels on your arm, how soothing it feels.
3. Hug yourself and aim for 20 seconds(Study at UCLA showed that's what it takes to release calming hormones). I know, sounds odd until you do it. Just put your arms around yourself, and hold yourself, maybe rock gently back and forth. Remember, we are turning off your anxiety which means shutting down the negative thoughts and releasing calming hormones.
4. Now let's really use your mind to your advantage. Remember a moment, right now, when you felt particularly safe, when you felt loved and when you felt cherished. It doesn't have to be a hugely involved memory, just one moment in your life. (For me it was when my dad would check in on me when I was sick and place his warm hand on my forehead to see if I had a fever. I never felt so safe and protected).

Simple, but powerful, exercises to try.

We are going to be okay. We've made it this far into a terrifying time in our collective lives. We can, and will, make it to the end. We have what it takes.

You are stronger than you realize. I hope this helps you as it has helped me.  Peace, all.",27,0.94,i7fvfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i7fvfu/freaking_out_regularly_like_i_am_a_few_simple/,2,Resources,2020-08-11,7,157,0.044585987261146494

I live in a county here in California where people see Covid as a hoax and don’t take it seriously. It has gotten so bad that Our hospital is overwhelmed. As of Thursday July 16th we only had 7 hospital beds left.

With that context, I found out I was positive for Covid on June 16th. I was quarantined for a whole month due to catching a outbreak at my hospital. It was the scariest thing of my life. Being 22 and not knowing if I am going to die or if I am going to live. I have so much to experience and so much life to give to this world that I now understand how valuable life is.

I have not been back to work because I am unable to finish tasks and be up more than 4-5 hours at a time without a nap. I have swollen feet and toes because when I am up it’s a battle for me to stand. I retreat back to bed immediately. At night when it’s time to sleep, I can’t. I’m scared I wont wake up.

2991,"Came in close contact, anxiety through the roof - fear of infecting family members. Sorry for the wall of text. Any assurance or advice would be very helpful. Thank you so much !

&#x200B;

I live in Bangladesh, South Asia. I went out to an office (due to necessity, I only went out 4-5 times throughout the last 3-4 months). It was a closed space with only a door open. There were two people and one of them was without any mask (on the table). I was too afraid/polite to say anything and had to sit beside him for a few minutes (4 minutes I guess). Then he wore the mask. But -

* this guy most likely is unaware of germs and how they spread (most people in the country and especially that area are like that, most are illiterate, don't practise social distancing, don't wear mask to protect others etc.)..
* This guy deals with all floors of these unaware people.
* I read that people NOT ONLY SPREAD IT THROUGH SNEEZING/COUGHING, but also through SPEAKING, BREATHING. I even found an article saying it only takes 50 minutes to infect someone else through breathing and 5-10 mins if all particles from talking were inhaled (take it w/ a grain of salt please). So he could have been breathing and talking in that small, closed room for 30 mins or even an hour.
* **I sat within 2-2.5 feet beside/angled towards him, he talked for 3-4 mins in other direction (not loudly), then he wore the mask and i had to stay another 7-10 mins in that space.**
* i KNOW I AM A STUPID. SHOULD HAVE SAID PUT IT ON AND SHOULD HAVE MAINTAINED DISTANCE. No need to call me out on that .....     :(
* I had to go through a few others as well (crowded footpaths) who were talking loudly and not wearing masks.
* I was wearing a surgical (could be fake ones) and another cheap one (fabric type) (later found out it was probably worn out on some parts)....i even shut out the gaps with paper towels. But my eyes were unprotected.

I am afraid because my mom has diabetes and very poor health (50 y/o). I am afraid that I may infect her and my other family members. I asked my doctor relative and he said it will be good to take precautions given the circumstances (mask + handwashing). But I think (sorry, not self-diagnosing, just feels like that) I have contamination OCD and it feels like I can't get rid of germ traces. (pillow where i sleep - touching it later, others handling the utensils, breathing inside the house for days, talking to someone masklessly.)

&#x200B;

I need someone to tell me -

* if that was indeed a risky encounter and i should take precautions.
* where is the line for being obsessive and being cautious?

&#x200B;

If possible I would like to give up all these hourly handwashing if I touch my face, what is touching what, etc...I can't relax like this. Please help.

&#x200B;

It's not just the possibility of catching something, but how should I act  indoors? Wearing mask might help me keep my aerosols/breaths to myself? Is that needed?

&#x200B;

**tl:dr; Sat within 2.5 feet of a guy without mask for 4 minutes (wore mask then another 10 mins) - who is likely unaware like the people he has to interact with - in that area (assistant of the landlord of a multi-storeyed building). People who live there roam masklessly and are largely underprivileged and illiterate (don't want to stereotype but true). It was a closed space. Afraid of infecting family members now and what should I do?**

2992,"I don't think my mental health will ever be the same again because of COVID19 even if we do go back to normal. So I have noticed my mental health lately just isn't getting better. Even with everyone trying to reassure me that everything will be okay. I want to believe that it will and things will go toward the right direction with this whole pandemic. It's not even just the anxiety of how a pandemic caused the country to go into lockdown and in other places toke it a lot further it just makes it feel like things will never be safe again.

I feel like there is always a chance I can get it the moment I step out of the home. I don't get fear to the point where it's bad, but I definitely always feel uneasy whenever I go out now. Whether I am worried someone won't stay 6 feet either because someone isn't paying attention or it's coincidence I bump into them around a corner. I am anxious about touching things that what I am touching could have COVID19 on it. That's why my hands nowadays feels more dry than before because I have increased my hand washing like way more than double the usual amount that I hand washed before. 

Even if life does go back to normal I am anxious if we will get another pandemic that will cause this whole thing to happen again. Not only that but we have seen news reports over second waves that have been happening in other countries. Which then causes you to worry if the virus will really ever get down to the point where it's safe to go out again.

All these things go on in my head that this whole pandemic has really affected me in a mental way and not for the better. Before I never had anxiety over anything really. I was happy to go to work, see my girlfriend, see my friends, go to stores, malls etc. without fear of getting something that is really dangerous. Now you can either get something that can make you really sick or even die in the worst circumstance. Or you can get this horrible virus, not even know that you have it and severely impact people in your life or you pass it on to some random stranger.

2997,"Covid-19 Does Not Discriminate by Body Weight Here's an article worth discussing about, one that you would never see posted elsewhere on reddit:

[

**tldr** \- Nutritionist Christy Harrison is essentially saying that results claiming COVID to be a 'fat people killer' are still inconclusive (and possibly inaccurate) due to limited data and poorly managed control groups in reports so far.

**My take** \- As someone who has a BMI of 42 (and dropping!), though under age 30 with no other conditions, reading this is a diamond in the rough. I think many of us can use any article that takes a step back from all those ""OMG FAT PEOPLE ARE ALL GOING TO DIE FROM COVID"" stories (which r/Coronavirus eats up) and gives their own well-researched take on this.

That said, I still believe obesity is a risk factor for COVID (though can be said of many diseases, so for me it's par for the course) and should remain listed as such. If nothing else, it could save lives of people who otherwise may never show a care in the world about this. However, at the risk of sounding like I'm justifying myself, I can't be the only one who thinks it's overkill to tell fat people with no other conditions (particularly in the 20-39 age group) to take as many precautions as someone who is say highly immunpromised and/or very old. As my doctor even said, everyone should be taking the same precautions regardless.

In the end though, even the highest risk people are far more likely to survive, but let's face it, that'd be too boring for news....

2998,"I feel like we could really be in a lot of trouble as a society after this pandemic. With the COVID-19 virus going around, and the way that certain people are reacting to it, I truly feel that this could be the end of the golden era of humanity. People are dying, and the mortality rate could be higher if hospitals be more overwhelmed. In addition, since most businesses are closed, we could enter a major economic depression, which could heavily damage a lot of people's lives.

The worst part is this ""new normal"" that a lot of people are preaching (especially journalists). Personally, I see this as fear mongering, as well as an attack on society. Why would we still need to worry after this virus is under control or has a vaccine? It simply does not make any sense.

If there is a depression, people will have to sell almost every enjoyable thing that they own, which would make life much less pleasant. Not to mention that they might have to give up their future goals (for example: wanting to move to Brooklyn, NY). This could devastate a lot of people, including myself.

I say I miss going OUT to eat.  The response I get:  Get takeout food.  As if eating takeout food at home even begins to resemble going out to eat.  It does not.

I say I miss going to the garage sales, thrift stores, and shopping in general.  The response I get:  Shop online.  I don't like online shopping and it is nothing at all like shopping in person.  No.  Just no.

Please, people.  THINK before you open up your mouth.  People aren't stupid and they know what their options are.  They know what they like and they know what will or will not work for them.  They know what their options are and if they  have rejected those options, they have their reasons.

3001,"Position on masks There are occasionally posts on this subreddit regarding how to obtain, make and wear masks that are out of line with advice from reputable agencies. Such posts do not help to reassure users who are already nervous and anxious and in some cases encourage extreme behaviour which is unhealthy.

N95 respirators masks are NOT suitable for wear by the general public:

[

The official advice on face coverings from WHO is clear:

[

""**Non-medical, fabric masks** are being used by many people in public areas, but there has been limited evidence on their effectiveness and WHO does not rmend their widespread use among the public for control of COVID-19. However, **for areas of widespread transmission, with limited capacity for implementing control measures and especially in settings where physical distancing of at least 1 metre is not possible** – such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments – WHO advises governments to encourage the general public to use **non-medical fabric masks**.""

This is also in line with advice on masks from the UK government:

[

""We know that coughing, sneezing, and even talking or breathing release droplets from the mouth that are a key means by which the virus spreads.  We also know that **cloth-based face masks** reduce the spread of those droplets \[..\] in situations **where physical distancing is not possible or predictable such as busy public transport, shopping and other potentially crowded public or workspaces**. 

**NOT 'everywhere'. NOT 'all the time'. NOT 'surgical masks' or 'N95 respirators'.**

Until there is peer-reviewed scientific evidence to the contrary, all posts andments taking an alternate position to the ones above will be removed, and posters who persist in pushing this view will be permanently banned.

If you are concerned about your chances of catching COVID19, by all means cover your mouth and nose with a scarf or bandana, or pull up your t-shirt.

(HYPOTHETICAL DON'T WORRY) The way I see it, there is no specific and clear finish line for the Covid pandemic, and if no immunization process is successful, be it by vaccines or ""natural"" - if the virus doesn't mutate too drastically and quickly - don't we risk having the virus around for so long that everyone risks a chance of not only getting it, but (eventually) dying from it?

3019,"For those still anxious about coronavirus, just remember, the worst has passed You may have heard the news, the United States just passed one million cases yesterday. It may seem hopeless, especially when the news media keeps on spinning the most negative stories. But I recently checked back on worldometers and other statistic websites to see where we were, and let me just say, I've never been happier during this pandemic then now.

Bottom line, things are getting better, and the peak is near

Yes, yesterday the US passed one million cases, but also on that day, the US reported over 23,000 new cases. That may sound like a lot, but throughout this month, the mean has been between 30,000 and 35,000, sometimes spiking above on the worst days.

This is the lowest number of new cases since March.

And it's a very, very good sign. It might possibly be a lull, but with a decline this drastic, paired up with the high amounts of new cases we were seeing just a few days ago, likelying from testing increases, and I have a feeling we may finally be starting to see the situation get better.

Moreover, people are recovering. And whilst the amount of people actually infected and have died might actually be higher, the amount of recoveries is also actually much higher than reported. This is because most cases are minor, and after they test positive for the virus, many don't go back once symptoms have cleared up. You can notice a discrepancy in some states. Most notably, some states, like Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina, have much lower active casespared to their total, and this is not due to high death rates, but because they're reporting the recoveries. In fact, in Louisiana, there's more people that have recovered than who still have the virus. Considering how Louisiana has some of the highest and most accurate testing rates of any state in the country, chances are the rest of the US might actually be in this position. Once we DO start seeing those recoveries being reported, then you will see the US peak in active cases. And I have every reason to believe the peak for not just the US, but the pandemic as a whole, will be in just a few days. It may very well happen this week. I'm keeping my fingers crossed on that.

Not only that, but many countries have already passed their peak of the pandemic, especially in Europe. Spain, Italy, Turkey, Ireland, etc. have all reached their peaks. The worst is over for them. And this is increasingly happening to other countries too. There's other statistics that are reassuring. For example, we are having more recoveries now than we've ever had. On April 24th, even though that day reported more new cases than any other day of the pandemic, at a staggering over 100,000 people infected, it also reported the most recoveries, with over 68,000. Not only that, but the amount of people reported in critical condition is dropping too. It peaked at just under 58,700 on April 23rd. Now we have 56,300. That number should continue to drop over the course of the pandemic. Lastly, the reported oues of the pandemic. The fatality rate should be expected to be between 0.7 and 4%, according to scientists, but the oue graph has looked different for a while, because with so many new infections, many of them started to die. The peak appeared to be on April 10th, when just 78% of people who had an oue recovered. 22% died. Those figures are beginning to look much better. 81% recovered, 18-19% dead. We should see these figures continue to space out as this pandemic continues, but it does recede. I also want to remind you that deaths have long peaked. The highest number of the whole pandemic was on April 17th, when over 8,000 people died. Yesterday, just over 4,500 people died, which is significantly less. And as with new cases, April 26th saw just over 3,700 people die, again, the lowest since March. In the US, the peak of deaths was last week on April 21st, when a little under 2,700 people died. Yesterday, however, it was just under 1,400.

Not only is this lining up with the popular IHMO predictions, which states things should've gotten much better by now, but the situations seems to actually possibly be going BETTER in some casespared to the projections. They predicted over 1,700 deaths yesterday in the US, but as previously mentioned, it was just under 1,400. For New York, the most badly affected state, they predicted that 325 people were going to die in New York yesterday, and whilst it was actually a little higher, considering the last reported death figure was 501 deaths on April 25th, it shows things are getting better as they predicted. And as for the UK, which they apparently have very bad predictions for, with over 1,200 people dying yesterday, it was actually just 360 according to Worldometers. Assuming trends continue, and all countries affected hit their peaks and then see declining active cases, we should reach a point close to when things started really going downhill in mid-March sometime in mid-June. By then, social distancing will likely have been greatly relaxed, most people who wanted a test will have gotten a test and the best-case scenario, treatment is available that will make the virus significantly less fatal.

And social distancing will eventually need to stop, not just for people's sanity. Even though he's been most wrong about the virus, Donald Trump has a point in saying that we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem. I remember watching a video about Ebola's impact on Africa, and they mentioned how the economic impacts of the virus might've actually killed more people than the virus itself. Chances are, this could very well happen, especially the longer we continue having the economy shut down. That's why I anticipate in the next few weeks, likely sometime in May, you will start seeing social distancing and lockdown policies be relaxed in most of the developed world, including the US. We can't do it now, and it likely won't happen this or even next week, but sometime in May, I anticipate you may start being able to actually talk to others and hang out again, if in a limited capacity. And they will get further relaxed over the course of the summer. Though some like Dr. Fauci claim of a second wave similar to the Spanish flu, we have to remember this ISN'T the flu, it's a coronavirus. A second wave might not happen, especially if we do this right. Remember, SARS, which COVID-19 is similar to, did not have a second wave, it just had THREE reported cases in 2004 and then that was the end of it. COVID-19 obviously isn't going to be like that, but whilst a second wave definitely shouldn't be a possibility to rule out, it may not even happen, so having plans for fall shouldn't automatically be dashed because of what you heard on the news. I'm saying this as China is starting to reopen everything and they haven't reported any sudden spikes of cases like some have feared. In fact, new cases and active cases is only further decreasing. Even if it were to decrease, they would now have the resources and knowledge to deal with it, and much like all of us, we wouldn't have to resort to lockdowns or stay-at-home orders to deal with it. With extensive testing, sanitation, and a prohibition on large gatherings (so you still may not see conventions and sports over the summer, but you could do most of your summer vacation stuff if you wanted to, granted, you may not be able to travel anywhere outside the country), we can have it to where life is effectively close to normal, whilst still having the virus in a manageable position. We're not going to be able to eradicate the virus this year, it's already infected way too many people, but we can make it much more manageable to where life can continue in a relatively normal capacity. It's been infecting tens of thousands of people this month every day across the world. If we can get those numbers down to the thousands or hundreds place, it'll be much easier to deal with, and life and the economy will be able to continue like normal.

Whilst everyone is trying to predict the future of the pandemic, we have to remember that ultimately, if you really think about it, viruses behave a lot like gases. My 7th grade biology teacher gave this analogy: someone farts in a room, nobody notices it at first, then it spreads, and they smell it, others begin noticing it too, until it covers the whole room, but then, over time as it is spreading across the room, it is dispersing, where as it spreads out, it covers less space, because the volume increases but the mass stays the same. Obviously, viruses kill, farts can't, so it's not exactly the same, but it works essentially the same, as you'll notice if you studied any other pandemic. It spreads across every country it can, infecting everyone in sight. When the virus runs out of hosts to infect, it burns out, it  disperses, and even much like the fart you let it, it no longer bes noticeable to anyone. Even if it is still physically lurking around, others have be preoccupied with other things as other gases take the original gases prevalence. The same goes with this current pandemic. Eventually, less people be infected, it bes more sporadic, people be more interested in other things beside the virus as fears lessen, and eventually, people move on. This will likely go down in the history books, but soon, this pandemic will be just that, history. Maybe a lesson for leaders to look to, to avoid the same mistakes. Maybe people will listen to science more and stop blindly putting their faith in ipetent politicians and the system.

The effects of the virus are going to linger well after the peak. People will still get infected, some businesses will stay closed, some places like Disney World will stay closed, sports may not be on for a while, and most notably, the economy. The worst year for Liberia during the Ebola epidemic was NOT in 2014 when it was at its worst, but rather 2016. It's entirely possible for some countries, 2020 will not be the worst year for the economy. In order to make sure these impacts are minimized, people and leaders and scientists must stay vigilant. For as long as the possibility of infection remains, scientists must keep researching, politicians must have their plans, our resources must be kept, for whateveres next, we have to stay vigilant.

But ultimately for whates next, things are going to get better. Life will likely re-open AT THE ABSOLUTE EARLIEST in mid-May, but it probably won't be until June. But the good news is the light at the end of the tunnel is beginning to shine, the possibility of normal life is graduallying back to our hands, and all this will be over before you know it.

We may have passed 1,000,000 cases in the US, but if we do things right, we may not see the 2,000,000th.

Ultimately, what all of these statistics mean is that whilst April may sound like Wake Me Up When September Ends, everything is lining up for May to instead sound like Through The Fire and The Flames...

3026,"Despite Negative Results I'm Still Scared I don't know what to do. I'm terrified I've acted recklessly and have endangered everyone around me.

For some background: on and off since May my throat had felt irritated like dry or scratchy, but never what I would call sore. I've also felt congested for a long time. Just the past couple of days it feels like I can breathepletely out of both nostrils since March at the least. I tested negative in June after going to a protest, and after that decided to start working at a restaurant handling take out orders. My dad works there in the kitchen, and my bf got hired as a waiter. I started to see my boyfriend before we both started working together in mid-July after protesting together as we live in a place where the number of cases dropped significantly. We're both in college and live with our respective families.

Last week, Monday, my throat felt off. Like, I had known it would get irritated because of allergies sometimes, but this felt a bit more scratchy. My bf came over in the evening, we hung out, and I was okay. Woke up the next day and throat and mouth are extremely dry. I drink water, take my temp and find it's normal, and then proceed to have a meltdown in front of my mom before work because I was terrified it was more than allergies. My bfes to pick me up for our shift andforts me but I'm still so scared and feel guilty. I chose not to talk to my boss because everyone told me he would flip out and it was probably just allergies. Thursday rolls around and my throat still feels weird but not nothing I haven't experienced before, yet I STILL cry before work because I'm so scared.

The next day, Friday, I decide to get tested to be safe. I was too ashamed to tell my boss because I'm convinced I've infected and doomed everyone I've been in contact with despite wearing my mask and EXCESSIVE cleaningpared to my co-workers. I instead decided to just quit my job later that evening and told him I was too anxious to work with the pandemic right now and he understood. My test came back negative Sunday and I was so happy. Then I read about false negatives and how if you still have symptoms you should remain isolated and I begin to panic again even though I've only had sinus issues and my throat was irritated. I also think I could've caught it at my shift Thursday and maybe it didn't show up because it was too close to Friday.

I am now convinced this is COVID. I had a meeting with my therapist yesterday and told her how I was scared and she told me that she doesn't think I acted recklessly, that I have the negative test result, and know I get allergies, but idk. Stupidly, I agree to let my bfe over yesterday and by the time evening rolls around my throat is sore. Like, it's definitely not just dry or scratchy. He tells me I'm overreacting, that it's all okay, that I haven't killed anyone, and I have a negative test result and no other symptoms so he isn't worried.

Now it's today and my throat is still sore but not unbearable. I can swallow without pain and my sinuses are cleared a bit. I'm considering isolating myself until my throat clears up but that doesn't change the fact I was careless and now have put a lot of people at risk. I also have OCD which tends to backfire on me in that if I start to overthink or feel like I'm acting too cautiously I try to push those urges away as they reinforce mypulsive behavior, so now I'm worried I've acted recklessly this past week to try and keep myself from spiraling.

3027,"Urgent Care visit. I am terrified I have been exposed Hi - I told my story in a previous post about an injury for which I was told I urgently needed to be seen. Terrified of Covid exposure at an Urgent Care or in an ER, I delayed medical attention.

Today nobody would see me for telehealth, on the grounds that this could be something horrible. A fracture! A dislocation! Internal bleeding! A dislocated or fractured *hip!* (I did not *injure* my hip. Zero pain in my hip. But the this bone is connected to the that bone, I guess?)  No, at least three different sources said I needed an exam, range of motion looked at in person by a doctor, an X-ray at the very *least*, ASAP.

So I finally picked a place and went in. I didn't find out until too late that the center treats Covid patients. For Covid.

My time there included a 1/2 hour claustrophobic stretch waiting in my patient room. I am terrified of who might have been in the room before me, what particles might still be airborne, what I was breathing.

The doctor, who was terrific, was so confident I was going to be OK that he didn't even seem to think I needed an X-ray, but we did one to be sure, since I was there. No fractures. Also, most everyone there was fantastic, nothing but appreciation for health care workers here.

I get it. They can't always do a telehealth because of the seriousness of the things you need to rule out.

But, I am distraught. *I never needed to go in*. Now it's too late and I am way more scared of getting Covid from this appointment than I ever was scared about my injury itself. Why did I do this?

Meanwhile, everyone else was walking in and out of the center calmly (in masks) without the least visible worry. The thing I hate most about the pandemic - other than the Coronavirus itself - is the constant feeling like I *just don't understand*.

Thank you for letting me vent. It's going to be a long couple of weeks.

3032,"The death rate is increasing while the recovery rate is decreasing So I check [this website]( regularly, and I noticed how the death toll is dramatically increasing, while the recovery rate is decreasing.  And that worries me, and I don't have a reason as to why unless I ask you to explain it to me.

And also, I forgot to mention this in my first post on this subreddit, but my stepfather is 67 years old.  He's the oldest in our household, with my mother being in the middle, around her late fifties to early sixties, and myself being thirty years old.  That means that he's the most likely to die from the coronavirus, especially with his cancer and respiratory problems that he has right now, and that worries me even more than getting myself infected, since I'm most likely to survive it.  Same thing for my mother, just less likely because of how much younger she isbined with her healthy lifestyle, but not by much herself, either.

Combine that with the dramatically increasing death rate versus the decreasing recovery rate, and you got yourself something more dire than it already needs to be, and one that could last for several months, maybe even longer than that.  So is there anything you guys can do to reassure me about the coronavirus and my stepfather being the most likely to die from it out of all three of us in the same household?

Please don’t think I am excluding the horrible sadness of people dying and the impede that it has on families.  That is horrible.  It’s so sad.  At this point, though, I’m pretty scared/freaked out about the economic failure and my anxiety is crazy about the overreaching in our privacy.  I saw a movie recently (based on a true story) about a guy who refused to fight for/pledge allegiance to the Nazis and the people in his town ended up turning him in and planning to kill him if he wasn’t in for war because they really thought fighting was the right thing to do.  I know it’s not a war, but I just see parallels because of people spying on you and contact tracing and stuff. 

I don’t want to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but the idea of contact tracing is really terrifying to me.  It really, really freaks me out that my fellow citizens will be watching me and keeping track of whoes into contact with who.  I’m just so creeped out and scared.  I know I sound crazy and i know we already give out info to Apple & Google and all of that but it seems so...oppressive and like scary historic events (okay fine, I’ll say it, it scares me that these slow movements that no one minded led to Nazi Germany &amp;amp; the Soviet Union.  I know I sound crazy but I’m serious).  Idk I keep thinking “those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it” and it freaks me out.

I just don’t like this.  It’s eerie, and people are so eager to contribute.  I’m sure you saw the article about the 170 privacy experts who warned against the contact tracing methods.  It’s alarming.  I’m really scared, but I don’t want to look crazy but idk...

She was just sluggish laying in bed watching Netflix and said that she lost her taste but she got better afterward and slowly regaining her taste. Now fast forward my dad came back positive with COVID! I honestly don't know whether he got it from me and passed it to my mom and she passed it on to my dad. My dad reassured me that he didn't get it from me that there was a lady at his job that was sick and sneezed on his back and my dad's back started to ache afterward.

That sounded ridiculous and now with the results yesterday that my dad is COVID positive and he gottened100% from me, even though my symptoms weren't as severe. I don't know what to do. I theorized I might be asymptomatic or I had COVID but I didn't show that many symptoms because my immune system is really strong. I don't have any underline symptoms and neither do my parents \*knock on wood\*. My dad is doing okay, he isn't feverish and he has an appetite but he has his ups and downs whether he's laying in bed moaning like a dying animal or he's uplifting weights in his room, it's giving me whiplash.

As of right now the three of us are all in quarantine with my mom and I taking care of my dad and he's doing well taking it easy. My dad now is solely using my bathroom and I moved into my mom's bathrooms and we are all keeping a healthy distance from him. I have to contact my professors that I've been contacted with the Coronavirus and I don't know if I got my classmates infected because my dad said he had a headache before I started school but I thought nothing of it because both my dad and brother get headaches anyway. I honestly feel at a loss here, I feel like a diseased monkey spreading the virus wherever I go or worse Typhoid Mary because I work in the food industry at school. I didn't know I had the virus and now my family has it and not sure if my classmates have it and I feelpletely fine and I hate this!

Edit: I forgot to add, I do suffer from yearly allergies and it's terrible. Water itchy eyes, stuffy nose, congestion, and mild sore throat, the whole shebang. Allergies in Florida are the thing of nightmares and it was the only reason I hadn't thought anything of it and at the same time, I had an ear infection. My ear canal was clogged and my throat felt sore which can all bemon symptoms to a cold and I was taking medication during that time. I have mild to severe ear infections from time to time that just ""pops up"" at random. Quite honestly I could've contracted the virus at my job and those symptoms may have been applied or not. I work in the Hardware department which rarely people gopare to the deli and the produce section. I'm usually alone but it doesn't mean I don't run into costumers. Unfortunately being a woman I get male costumers and male coworkers who think social distancing doesn't apply to them and they are unnecessary close to me or touching me to get my attention. I could've gotten COVID in the bathroom because we share bathrooms with the costumers or the deli lady who made my Checker burger sneezed on my pattie and I ate it for lunch. COVID is impossible to avoid and impossible to detect and I realize it the hard way. Right now I feel fine, I just did some exercise and cleaning up my room and I won't know for sure if I have it but I'll get tested tomorrow. I'll update soon!",2,0.6,ijcxah,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ijcxah/my_dad_has_covid_and_he_got_it_from_me/,8,Support,2020-08-31,-46,286,-0.16083916083916083

So I caught the corona, pretty sick for 3 days, then slowly recovered. Ever since then I've been in this false sense of security of ""I can't catch it again probably"".

Today I was in Walmart to get some stuff. I had my mask on of course, and went into the cashier line. This older black lady kept looking at me funny and she said something. I was wearing my airpods so I took them off, came a step closer and said ""I""m sorry?"" and she said ""You are in my space."" and in my head I thought ""bitch we're in a Walmart this is everyone's space""

we went by the vegas strip to see how empty it is.  there were police EVERYWHERE.  that made me feel good... I was happy they are ramping up security. other than cars, no one really around.

casinos closed.

as we drove , some roads blocked.  as we passed Wynn - a road was blocked, and police motioned for us to use the Wynn entry to do a U turn.

so we did.  as we go through - right at the entry point - 5 Wynn security guards circle our car.  blocking path. and they keep motioning to roll window down.  flashlights pointed at us.

I tried to motion that we doing U TURN. ... they drew closer... and one started banging on the window to roll the window down.  I cracked the window open.

I screamed out so he could hear ""we are doing a u turn!""

he goes ""I know but I need to see your face"".

at that point my options were - to run them over - or open the window.  they werepletely surrounding the car in that moment. so I rolled the window down.

and - he proceeded to shove his face IN OUR CAR to get a good look at us. and breathe on us.

ii was FURIOUS.  I wanted to get out and yell at him.  but I figured the quicker we get out of there the safer.  so we drove home.  it resulted in anxiety for a few hours for us.

I have ideas for next time - maybe drive less haha.  but also maybe have a sign I can post to the windshield in these cases telling idiots like this to BACK THE F- UP from the car.

statistically i'm sure it's fine... but now i'm contacting corporate. i'm gonna need them to monitor that staff employee and let me know asap if they get sick.

what kind of imbecile service industry training is this? during a quarantine, when you've shut down your hotels and casinos, have countless infected IN your work... you are training people to put their heads in cars???? do they not realize there's a social distancing/quarantine in effect?

I also get they were anxious and nervous. they likely wanted to make sure we not going on the property to do damage.  I get it.

3084,"Husband's work does not require employees to wear masks when sitting at their desks My husband's employer wants to get the pany culture"" back (eye roll), so has started having high level employees return to the office. My husband's first day back was today, although he can do his job from home. Employees are provided with masks, but they only need to wear them while away from their desks. No one, including my husband, is wearing them while sitting.

He is not a worrier, but it's freaking me out. My husband sits at a low wall cubicle, but plexiglass partitions have been put up between employees. For the time being, he has someone diagonally behind him and all other spots next to him are empty. 

I have anxiety and depression and have taken covid very seriously. We didn't even see family in-person at the beginning of the pandemic. Eventually, my sister starteding into our house because she was being equally careful. It has been wonderful for our mental health (she also suffers from anxiety/depression). We agree it's the one time we can pretend things are ""normal."" I have two young sons and it has been so beneficial for them too. 

We had decided we would keep seeing each other when my husband went back to work. We thought that everyone at the office would wear a mask except when eating. Any risk of my husband catching covid seemed insignificantpared to the reward of spending time with my sister.

Now, we don't know what to do. I am so upset because I feel like it's no longer safe for my sister toe over. Worst case, we're thinking of hanging out in my sunroom with windows open, a space heater and masks. I also have such fear that my husband will catch covid. He's 33, but it seems like this virus often doesn't discriminate. If he gets seriously ill or dies because he was forced to go to work, I don't know what I'll do.

My husband recognizes how upset I am and is willing to wear a mask while not eating, drinking or talking on the phone. This of course does not change the fact that others in the office are also not wearing masks while sitting at their desks.

I am wondering if anyone has had to make similar decisions about seeing family, or is working in circumstances like my husband. I'd like to know if I'm overreacting. We are in Illinois and in our low to mid 30's. My sister's husband has asthma, but we're otherwise healthy.

TL/DR: my husband's work allows employees to remove their masks at their desks. Everyone is doing so, and I feel that not only are we at risk of getting covid, but it's no longer safe to see my sister.

3085,"Legal type Question about the Families First Act I and at least 7 other coworkers from my 4 offices contracted Covid from attending a work happy hour that was organized during business hours (those who were working that day got paid until their normal shift was over; the happy hour started at 4 so some got paid until 5 and some until 6). It was my scheduled day off, but I felt an unspoken pressure to go because everyone in ourpany loves to socialize and hang out together, and if you don’t do so, you sort of be part of the out crowd and not the in crowd, if you know what I mean. I’m new, so I definitely felt like I “should” go, even though I didn’t really want to and no one specifically said in words that I had to go. 

So I get there and everybody’s eating and drinking and crammed into a little room, about 20-25 of us. Of course, no one is wearing masks, either. Because of this, I felt weird wearing my own mask, so I didn’t, even though I’ve been very good about taking every precaution otherwise. I’m not seeing friends or family and only going to the stores I need to and picking up food that I need to. 

I now regret allllll of that. 

Within days, people at the happy hour started getting sick and testing positive for Covid. 

The happy hour was a Wednesday, we were told on Friday that someone was positive. On Sunday, we were told 4 more people had tested positive. One of which was my manager, that I’d had very close direct contact with all week, because it’s impossible not to in my office. 

I was told to report to work on Monday (the only one in the office), and sit in the office where I was stewing in potential germs, and had been all weekend. I got tested on my lunch break. I was then told later in the afternoon that I couldn’te back to work until I had a negative test to show. Well, as of yesterday (Thursday), I had also tested positive. 

Because so many people had tested positive, they’ve had to shut down all 4 of our offices until October 5th. They said we would all get paid our regular pay during the shutdown, even if we didn’t test positive. Those who tested positive fall under the Family First 2 week pay thing. 

I have decided that due to contracting Covid at a work function, and because of various other facts but also because most of our customers aren’t wearing masks in themon areas that are very highly trafficked (think hotel setup), I no longer feel safe and don’t want to work for apany that thought it was ok to run their business this way. 

I have since gotten another job offer to start on 10/12. 

If I give notice to my current employer that I don’t feel safeing back to work on 10/5 when our office re-opens, am I still eligible to be paid during the shutdown under the Families First Act? If I go back on 10/5 and then tell them I don’t feelfortable being back in the office and then turn in my keys without notice, am I still eligible to be paid under the Families First Act? 

I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot, but THEY and their lack ofmon sense are what caused us all to get sick in the first place, they’ve chosen to pay everyone during the shutdown even if they’re not positive, and we have no option to work even if we wanted to. I’m just afraid they’ll try to say that by giving notice or quitting, I’m somehow rendering myself ineligible for the pay under the FFCA.",0,0.5,izq0qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/izq0qx/legal_type_question_about_the_families_first_act/,0,NA,2020-09-26,2,190,0.010526315789473684

Im 32, 490 lbs, and living with an essential roommate. Last Saturday he went to the house of his fave barber to get a line up and a 360 wave improvement. there was about 7 other people in the house with him... Then he went with a co-worker to tag along as the co-worker did some business.

My roommate is a fabricator for amercial plumbing and drainage firm. He can get a mask if he wants to, but is reluctant to do so - he's a bit of an oddball. So I was giving him a massage on the living room couch. As I was finished with his feet, he took a deep exhale - this from a man who in his late 50s, overweight, and with apnea. He sneezed once today, and that was before he ate his food (he washed his hands) After the message I went to check up on the news. While I was being informed I suddenly remembered the talk about asymptomatic, respiratory droplets and aerosols and my anxiety meter went through the roof.

3098,"A Challenging Situation of Coronavirus for International Students - Impact and solutions **Remember: Crisis is temporary but dreams are forever.**

After the shock of the sudden spread of the COVID-19 outbreak, you may be worried that you will not be able to study abroad at least this year which can put a pause to your career. Although the situation is a bit worse right now, we want to encourage you to keep your dreams or plans continued, as we know the situations are temporary and everything will be back to normal soon. You will just have to re-plan your decisions for the next few months. So, here are the ways you can adjust to this crisis, while also not giving up on your dream of studying abroad:

**1. Continue your application process if it started.**

If you have decided to study abroad this year, that means you must have already started your application process. And suddenly the virus has emerged as a hurdle in between. But still, you should keep going with the application process as the academic year start of 2020 might not be lost just yet. Usually, the classes in most of the universities would start around in the months of September-October. While it’s difficult to estimate as to when we will be out of this crisis for sure, as the virus is spreading at a high speed, some estimations mention the period between May and July. And then you can start your classes abroad. In fact, some universities are still accepting online applications from international students at this time. If this situation continues further than July, universities will adapt to these changing conditions. Just like students, Universities are also affected by the situation and they will adjust the application and enrolment deadlines which suits the changes in the academic year schedule. So, try to continue going through the steps of the application process. Contacting universities for more information will be best for more clarity. If applications are postponed by the university, then it is the best tie for you to do research about visa information and work permit information, if you plan to work while studying abroad. Some universities have already extended the application dates in August.

**2. Postpone your studies for the beginning of 2021**

If you have not started the application process and want to wait till the problem is solved, there are no issues, you can postpone your international studies for 2021. Or maybe you want to change your initial study destination because it is among those countries which are affected most by the virus. Just because you are not starting your classes this year doesn’t mean you can’t start researching your future study options and decide by January 2021, when the new applications start. Here is how we can help until you start applying:

* Figure out what you want to study and in which country you want to pursue.
* You can check the list of courses and select the course you want to pursue
* Check out the programs, universities cost, etc everything you want to know about study abroad.
* Read about your study options based on careers after graduation
* Read about the exams you will be in need to clear to study abroad like English proficiency exam IELTS or TOEFL and entrance exams like SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT. Prepare for your test and score a good result.TOEFL already launched a way for students to take their language test from home.
* After the quarantine ends, you can gather some professional experience by volunteering, getting a short-term job, or starting an internship. Universities prefer the students who have some work experience for a Master's degree such as an MBA. Click here to know more: MBA universities abroad

Make good use of your time staying at home by doing your research thoroughly,paring your options and figuring out where you’re going to apply next year.

**3. Study an online degree**

Many prospective international students are considering changing their study plans altogether, and they’re looking at online study options offered by prestigious universities all over the world. Online studies don’t mean low-quality education. Many universities have started offering more online Bachelors and online Masters as a result of the outbreak. This option will likely not delay your study plans too much, as many online degrees have rolling admissions, meaning you can apply anytime. You will still have to meet the admission requirements necessary to apply. Classes can start at any time or once every few months. Just make sure you have the right system requirements on your PC or laptop. The only downside is that your online degree might take more years topletepared to on-campus options, depending on the course intensity.

**4. Keep learning with online short courses**

No matter which one of the previous options you’re going to choose in the future, you should also not give up on your personal development right now. There is an abundance of online short courses to keep you learning and help you manage your time staying at home. Many of these short distance learning courses are also offered free of charge, and a lot of institutions provide support for people around the world. Setting aside some time every day for an online course can help you better schedule your day and keep your motivation and mental health up. Whichever path you choose to follow, don’t give up on your education dreams and never stop learning.",0,0.5,frq3v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/frq3v2/a_challenging_situation_of_coronavirus_for/,0,NA,2020-03-31,-6,353,-0.0169971671388102

We’ve only known about this virus for about 6 months now and a lot ofpanies are already saying that they think they’ll have an effective vaccine by the end of the year. Honestly it just doesn’t really seem possible to me. 

Part of me thinks that all thepanies and scientists are telling us that we’ll have a vaccine sooner than we actually will because people would lose all hope if they told them it will be a lot longer. People can hang on and isolate for a year. But it’s just not sustainable to isolate for much longer than that. I think scientists are afraid that if they told people the truth, they would just forgo a lot of the precautions because we can’t live like this for another 4 years. 

The other thing is that even if we somehow have a vaccine by the end of this year or beginning of next year, we still have to distribute it to enough of the population to reach herd immunity. The US alone has about 328 million people (not to mention the rest of the world). That would mean that in order to go back to normal sometime next year, we would need to make and distribute about 7 billion doses of a vaccine that may or may not be effective.

3111,"How to handle the virus when it hits (just fought out my battle and passing on my experience) Ok, I was showing mild signs of a cold for about 4 days, first symptoms were super easy going.

I occasionally experienced mild disorientation and confusion, and a little difficulty breathing, but not anything to report.

When it hit me, a lot of those mild symptoms remained the same, and didn't escalate. So I retained a feeling that I wasn't ""really sick"".

And as I was chatting to a friend over messenger, I suddenly couldn't type or respond to say ""I'm fine"". I became confused, dizzy, disoriented, I waded through options in a confused haze, not wanting to call an ambulance because I didn't want to create a fuss. But I did a test online that was set up by the health services and it said ""contact this number immediately"". I had every symptom except a fever (I had severe chills, traumatic shortness of breath, and disorientation and was barely conscious).

I called the ambulance and realised I could barely speak more than a few words without losing my breath. My voice was distorted by how weak my breath was. The ambulance said they would take an hour and I was like ""nice, thank you"".

I sat and waited, and began having even more trouble with my breathing, to the point I woke up a friend of mine to watch me in case I passed out. I at this time could not breathe very well at all, and was scared that if I lost consciousness I might not be able to regulate my breathing (because breathing required a lot of effort, and if you can imagine that when you are passed out you breathe a lot more passively).

I sat still and tried to stay conscious, and began stopping responding to verbal stimuli. So was on the middle of the consciousness spectrum between needing to be prompted with pain to respond. The pain was in my chest, and felt similar to how I might imagine a heart attack or stroke. My friend called the ambulance to arrive quicker.

40 minutes after calling they arrived, and put a kit down on the table full of gear and instruments and put electrodes over my chest and kept me talking. At one point I didn't respond for a few sentences, and constantly lost my train of thought, unable to respond very well.

My blood pressure was 132/91 and my heart beat was 125bpm. I now believe it was that high to increase oxygen flow (because later on as I recovered, the oxygen level in my blood was less as my heart rate went down). So at this point I had no fever but extreme chills, I was rather extremely shaking from chills, and clamminess. They found my blood sugar was low (hyperglycemia) aswell which was weird as I ate well the night before and don't have diabetes of any kind and am in good shape at 33.

Basically my readings were borderline (though it doesn't feel borderline!). And they said that due to my age its probably better not to go into hospital and weather it out, and I was like ""so, explain to me why I can't breathe"" and we went through everything to the point it was clear that it wasn't yet pnemonia (as it would note on that sudden) and that currently there wasn't liquid in the lungs, and I was getting decent oxygen. Seems fine right?

Well, I slightly recovered after that first hour, and I let the medics go and decided that if it hit me again hard like that I'd go in, but for now I'd tackle it on my own.

But, it came and went in waves. I believe my body kept releasing endorphins or hormones in waves, and when those hormones came on I became very calm, and then it would receed and the anxiety and feeling inside my body was so intense that I describe it like... I was fighting in a boxing match winded, getting hit to the body, and being forced to then swim in water with limited ability to breath. THEN fever hit, and chills, and violent cramps, and extreme feelings of anxiety and honestly wanting to scream or cry... Horrifying... like some saw movie.

BUT, I was conscious, and breathing, which was what I focused on. I focused on being calm, and held myself together. I sat upright to help my breathing, and drank apple juice, sodas, etc to make sure there were no other thingspounding with it.

It felt like... a stroke or heart attack in how suddenly it hit and how little control I had over such a vital function as breathing. BUT if I was calm enough, if I kept my energy level up, I could maintain my hold on it. In the peak of it my face went red, and my friend almost called the ambulance again but I told him to give me a minute first. And I was violently shaking, but felt like... I felt like my body had ""spotted it"", and it felt like blood was rushing through my body at a far greater pressure and everything sort of fizzled and burned hot. And then it felt like the grip on my lungs released a bit.

By 14 30, I could breath half okay again and wasnt teetering on the edge of consciousness. It had begun at about 6 30 (when I was woken from my sleep by a clammy strange silent feeling).

And as I measured my heart rate as I recovered it came down to 95, then twenty minutes later 91, then later 87, then 85, then 83, then 75... and the hormone waves kept hitting through this time, so every so often I'd get knocked out like I was injected by a sedative, which relaxed me and improved my breathing but then everything got intense again.

Then, it washed away. I had to be careful and move slowly, but it slowly turned into what feels like larangitis.

My tips are this:

Peoples symptoms will be different, but if you have shortness of breath, that is the hardest part to deal with

If shortness of breath is sudden onset, try to keep calm and conscious and get someone to watch over you. Do a distil pulse test to check your blood oxygen saturation (some mobile phones can do this, but the paramedics have them too). If it is above 95% you are probably okay, lower and you might need a ventilator. I thought at the time that if you have difficulty breathing and are about to pass out, that this is because of low oxygen levels. I don't know what makes breathing so unbelievably hard, or what makes you nearly unconscious, but if you CAN stay conscious, do so, by regulating your breathing, staying calm. Make sure you have eaten, drunk, and the virus hasn't somehow strangely affected you.

Continue to drink as it improves how much blood you have in you, and eat. (I mean I didn't want to, everything tasted horrible, and I wanted to throw it up, could barely taste or smell).

Stay in the moment, have a friend there if you can. Ride it out as controlled and without panic as you can.

I was prepared to keep feeling that way for a week, but luckily it stopped, then afterwards, all the pent up traumatic pain of it all came flooding out in an outpouring of emotion. If I wasn't such a tough guy I would have started sobbing for hours because of how utterly world shaking it was.

Explaining the feeling:

My condition was upper moderate, I am young

The feeling was not like a cold, flu, or normal virus

It felt to me, like a heart attack or stroke, or extremely severe anxiety attack mixed in with it.

It felt like a serious disease, like some tuberculosis craziness... horrible. Traumatizing.

Reiterating the tips:

Stay calm, have someone with you, try to keep conscious, maintain a pacing in breathing. Make sure you have eaten, drunk... and if you aren't sure, sugary liquids like apple juice, etc get absorbed quickest. Have tons of water.

You won't get pnemonia on the first day most likely, so don't panic. If your blood saturation is above 95 you probably dont need ventilators. If your heart rate is like 125, try to be calm, hopefully your body will kick in with endorphines or adrenalines and relax you in waves so you can better breathe.

Everyone's symptoms will be different. How should you deal with that? Get facts and help if you can.

Do not gaslight yourself that ""you are not sick"" if you are disoriented and short of breath, but also dont just react too quickly. Just get your friends aware, and have someone watch you, literally sit with you.

Do this and you can be okay.

&#x200B;

Opinions:

This would be utterly terrible for an elderly person, like throwing them into a boxing ring with mike tyson. IF they get moderate or above symptoms, with the breathing troubles... It just hits SO HARD it can send you into some kind of shock.

Do not willingly catch it. I would go so far as showering after shopping trips, definately wearing masks, and definately washing hands. Don't stay near anyone that is like ""its just a cold"", don't russian roulette it. And don't carelessly go near elderly with it. It is one HELL of a trauma. Like I feel like I legitimately need a bit of therapy. That really really really hurt, like some alien constricting my lungs from within. Hard to describe as anything but like black magic grabbing my lungs to terrifying life and death levels.

But afterwards, there is some light. I feel it ""pushes over"" as much as it beats you to a pulp. A bit like the war of the worlds where suddenly the aliens just disappear. In fact that movie, describes it almost perfectly.

But you get hit THAT hard, and you are old? (if its above moderate and you have breathing issues) Avoid it, and if you get it, seek SUPPORT.

3112,"An American living in Shanghai's story So, I rarely use reddit, but after having seen so many people freaking out and also spreading false/insensitive information that people actually believe, I decided to find a platform where I could show my perspective. 

Some background - I'm an ethnically Chinese, American citizen that goes to an international high school in Shanghai. I moved there from Boston when I was six.

Recently, we were just about to go on our Chinese new year break. I left school not thinking anything would change, however as you all know, I was very wrong. This was around the time that the virus started to spread to the Eastern parts of China, and inpliance with the Shanghai Education Committee's rules, our school and all other schools in Shanghai, international or local had to cancel school until the 17th of February, my end of season basketball tournament along with it. This of course brought uncertainty to my entiremunity, and these sneaking suspicions of the virus getting even more out of hand soon became true, as the government then ordered that all the schools would be cancelled until some time in March. This ""time"" in March has still not been announced. This caused my whole family to freak out, as different countries started to close their borders to people who have been in China in the last 14 days. Fearing that we would be somehow trapped, my mom told us to pack our bags and booked a last minute flight to Taiwan, and then left our dog in a pet shop to live in until we would hopefully return.

I know that I'm extremely lucky to be able to first of all live in Shanghai and not Hubei, and second, be able to leave the mainland so easily, especially after hearing some extremely depressing stories of families trapped in Hubei. I wasn't the only person to have this idea to leave mainland ASAP, however, many of my friends decided to stay behind, either because it was an extremely inconvenient time to leave, or because their parents didn't think that the virus was that serious. Now, many countries are not allowing them in, so they are basically stuck in Shanghai, but they are still allowed to go outside, however their activities are limited heavily. After a week in Taiwan, we were supposed to go to Singapore, because my mom's work had an office there, however, the day before we were supposed to leave, Singapore announced that effective the next day, they would not let people who were in China mainland in the last 14 days in. Panicking, we again, booked a last minute flight to Singapore and left as early as possible. 

Now, you might be thinking I'm studying of if I'm studying at all (tbh you probably aren't thinking this), and the answer to that is, my school is doing e-learning - posting the assignments online and having us take pictures of our work and send it into the teachers. This certainly is NOT as good as real school, and I know every single one of my friends and classmates can say the same. Education is being greatly affected, especially for the Juniors and Seniors of all schools. Their SATs and ACTs were cancelled, and all AP tests were postponed. While I am not a Junior or Senior, I canpletely understand why all of them are panicking; I have a sister who is a Senior right now. 

My family plans to fly back to Shanghai on the 13th of March, however, the situation is still extremely unstable, and we aren't certain that it's the best option, despite my whole family's homesickness and how we all miss my dog. Now, there are a whole lot of insensitivementsing around, and at this point, I feel like some people are downplaying the effect of the virus. Children are dying. 20-30 y/o adults are dying. People - its not just the ones who are old that are dying, and despite having a lower chance of dying from the virus if you're younger, you do not want to contract it and give it to your family. There are numerous cases where this virus has sadly wiped out entire families in China, and they just aren't being reported to the mainstream media. I urge people to not spread false and insensitive information, because it just causes more panic, however, do not downplay the potential damage that this virus can cause. Wash your hands, protect yourself in public especially if you are in a risky country, and do not be insensitive, as real people are really suffering from this event. 

P.S. my relatives are doing fine. My grandparents were in America long before the virus and are still there. My uncle and his family went to visit them before the virus, and are also still there. 

TLDR: Im an American living in China and school got cancelled as the virus spread. My family, along with many others left mainland ASAP, but not everyone did and now they are stuck in Shanghai. School is now online learning. People are saying this is no big deal, but it's not only old people that are dying. Stay safe.

Case counts in my county don’t look like they’re exponentially increasing anymore and our hospitalization counts look like they’re topping off as well. 

Are we not supposed to go out until we reach less than 20 case counts a day and the hospitals are cleared out of patients? Will that day ever fuckinge? I’m so impatient and the majority of my age group is too. Not sure if that makes me an irresponsible person. I don’t eat indoors at restaurants. I don’t go to the mall. I don’t go to the gym. I don’t go on pointless Target runs. I always wear my mask when I go thru drive-thrus. I’m just gonna have this internal battle with myself for the rest of the year of whether or not to stay home or not, whether or not what I’m doing is irresponsible. This uncertainty is killing me, but I don’t want to be inside my apartment for the rest of the year. What is my age group supposed to do when we see that our age group isn’t affected like the older age groups are? I’m not arguing to stop wearing masks. Can we resume our normal lives but just wear masks when we go out to public spaces? How dangerous are small, intimate hang outs?

3149,"Halloween Safety It's the most wonderful time of the year! (To me, at least)

But, if course, this year will be different. There's a pandemic going on and we have to take a different approach to things. 

I'll level with you all, I've lost just about all hope in the CDC. I've been very disappointed with how they've dealt with pressure from the White House and I don't really look to them for guidance, anymore. Instead, I look to other healthcare professionals and doctors I work around. Some of these people have been treating illnesses for longer than I've been alive. I've spoken to a few different professionals who have all said the same thing; masks work, washing your hands is better than hand sanitizer, but hand sanitizer is better than nothing, don't touch your face, and keep contact short/limited. So far, this has done well. I, and others close to me, have stayed healthy and safe using this method. We also use the great outdoors to talk to people when we need to since being outside lessens the virus' ability to spread by dispersing the droplets. 

But I've seen some suggestions discouraging trick or treating this year. I can't help but wonder why because it takes place outdoors, contact is super short, if there's even any at all, and masks prevent the spread of large droplets... Is this really anymore dangerous than going to work, school, or to the grocery store??? I'd think it was safer since work, school, and shopping take place inside a building. 

As far as candy goes, I'd decided to hand out ONLY wrapped candy. That way it can be sanitized, I don't have to touch it, and the kids don't, either. 

If we can go through the drive through at a fast food place and be safe, why is wrapped candy less safe? 

We always did candy bags, so everyone got the same amount of goodies. The bags also keep things separate. 

Everyone in my state hasn't been following the rules, anyway... Lots of defiance towards mask wearing. I will say, though, that depends on where you go. Walmart? No masks or incorrect mask wearing. Aldi? People obeying the mandate. Odd, but true. 

I've still been shopping and living my life, just with a mask and sanitizer at the ready. I don't touch my face and I use the wipes stores hand out to wash the buggies off. I love those!

3150,"Isolation made me remember you I broke it off last year. At the time I felt it was what was best for both of us. I had to branch out in college, and there were things that we did not agree with going forward into the relationship. You were my first love, and I was yours. 

I wasn’t too heartbroken and jumped into a relationship 2 months later. Surprise surprise, the relationship did not last long and this time I ended up getting hurt since I found out she was cheating on me. I was so hurt over this girl that I began doing drugs and sleeping around to distract myself. This girl took up all my headspace. 

And then COVID happened. 

I had to move back from college and say goodbye to everyone I met there. I moved back in with my parents and slowly I began losing connections. These past months everyone has sort of drifted away, and once again I find myself alone. The crippling loneliness and isolation has been haunting me ever since. The feeling of worthlessness after getting cheated on has really fucked with me. And then I remembered you. 

The way you were always there for me when my depression and anxiety would spike up and you would calm me down. The way that you accepted me despite all of my glaring flaws and insecurities. Unlike her, You were there for me in the worst of times. Now, the world is crumbling, my physical and mental health is declining…

But you’re not here.

3152,"If you are a supervisor or manager of those working from home, I rmend group meetings to help people feel less isolated No human engagement for 8 hours a day, especially with the undercurrent of stress of the world seeming to fall apart, fear for yourself and loved ones, and job insecurities due to loss of customers, can really mess with someone. I think a meeting now and then, under any pretense (maybe just to outright shoot the breeze!), can help people stay centered when they are forced to stare at a screen for eight hours a day.

As a personal anecdote, I work in a small department. When I went onsite, we had bi-weekly meetings and had lots of work discussions with each other. Then suddenly I'm working from home. I live alone, so I have no one anymore to say hi and bye to. No one I'm passing in the hall, no co-worker I can wave to. The change for me was pretty abrupt.

To make it worst, we stopped having much reason to IM or talk at all since our tasks changed due to emergency issues by thepany trying to survive. My leadership and one or two others were extremely busy, while the rest of us were somewhat left to fend for ourselves, begging other departments for work. Our reasons to meet as a team were on the back-burner and tons of meetings were cancelled or pushed out.

I've worked from home before, and after a couple years I started to lose it. This time it took me 25 days. It's hard to explain what happened to me, but I really do think I lost part of my mind. Not even sure I've recovered yet, or ever will. I wonder if being furloughed would have been easier, because at least then I could concentrate my time on processing my feelings, instead of the unhealthy processing I did while trying to work with people without any true interaction.

I don't really know how it has been for my co-workers, all of whom live with people. But I know everyone struggles to some degree from the pandemic. My manager and her manager finally decided we'd have a meeting,ing up next week, just to talk and re-connect. Everyone seems excited to finally interact. It will definitely help me, and also last week my manager gave me more tasks to occupy me with, which has helped tremendously. May be too late in some ways, but it all helps.

So if anyone has a similar situation where you and your colleagues are suddenly working at home, perhaps prioritize interactions even if it seems like there are more important issues and that time for those in leadership is a preciousmodity. Yes, keeping thepany afloat is a priority, but retaining your employees, and keeping them sane, is also a priority.

Already one co-worker is quitting for another job, though I don't know anything about his motivations. But I wouldn't be surprised if more, especially from another department I work with, will quit when able to find something else. And the reason in their cases would perhaps be the kind of madness the pandemic brings, warping everything, yet so easily held at bay by a friendly voice now and then.

Again, this is my experience and my thoughts. I'm curious what others have experienced in similar work situations?

I generally follow social distancing rules pretty well, but I'm not 100% - eg. I go out more than once per week for groceries (maybe 2 or 3 times), I get a beer at the liquor store a few times per week, I do a few other errands (eg. I dropped my bicycle off at my local bike shop to be fixed recently), and I visit my girlfriend in a nearby city several times per week.  She is as close to 100% social distancing as her work allows.

Other than that, I work from home, talk to friends and family online or on the phone, wash my hands after venturing out, wear a mask when I go out, use hand sanitizer, disinfect objects brought into my apartment, and meet up with nobody socially (aside from my girlfriend, as mentioned).

For some people, I'm ""social distancing"".  However, a couple of friends of mine seem to be meeting the guidelines 100% - at least, their rage at anyone who isn't 100% is frightening to behold, so I presume they are close to perfect in their habits.

I disagreed, and told her the opposite would be not changing my habits at all, and that I'm 90% there, and I feel that's sufficient.

I haven't found many articles or discussions about small differences in degree of social distancing like this, and the righteous anger displayed by the 100 percenters at those who are close but not perfect.

3156,"Recovering from COVID Hi guys, I'm a healthy 20 year old who runs collegiate track and follows a pretty strict diet and I've never smoked/vaped/drank/etc. I just want to explain what it was like for me to hopefully calm some of you down. I also want to point out I never officially tested positive before I continue.  
I haven't been sick in over 10 years and because I have a fairly good immune system Ipletely blew off this whole virus and took advantage of the reduced traffic and cheap flights.   
2 weeks ago I went to a couple Jazz games (where the virus started in the NBA). On Saturday I flew to Las Vegas for a party, then flew to Los Angeles and ran the LA marathon on Sunday and went surfing in Santa Monica the same day. On Monday I went surfing in Huntington Beach, walked down 2nd street and hiked signal hill. Tuesday I went to DisneyLand. Wednesday I flew back to Las Vegas because COVID was really blowing up and I knew it would be empty, I walked around and went to the theatre to watch birds of prey. I flew back to LA to go to Universal Studios with some friends on Thursday. And Friday I hiked up to the Hollywood sign then went to Venice beach and played basketball/worked out at Venice Beach with them then we went to 3rd St. Promenade to finish the day.

Friday was my first day of showing symptoms, I had a slightly dry throat but I dismissed it because I was thinking I must've drank a little too much saltwater while surfing so I just drink an extra bottle before I go to bed and everything would be cool.

Saturday I flew back to school from LAX which probably didn't help, but I had woken up with the worst sore throat I had ever felt. Luckily I live alone in my dorm so I quarantined myself. In my dorm I have a lot of Gatorade, cliff bars, and other sports nutrition and I will say room temp Gatorade seriously helped my sore throat. By the end of the night I was feeling kind of cold making me think I had a fever which I fixed it by turning up my room temp to 80.

I woke up Sunday with my throat feeling even worse and I noticed after I got out of the shower I could see my hair steaming in the mirror making me know I had a fever. I also had diarrhea Saturday which I can't even remember when the last time I had diarrhea was so I finally told myself that there was a good chance I got the virus.

On Monday I wanted to go biking or for a run, and I did a relatively light workout for me but pretty shortly I was feeling fatigued and my throat was hurting so bad I was getting hard to breathe. I was having a bunch of dry coughs as well so I called it quits and decided to drink more Gatorade and take a nap. I stayed pretty inactive the rest of the day, you know just YT, Netflix, seeing how much homework I had to do and I had more diarrhea throughout the day.

Tuesday I woke up with my eyes feeling pretty puffy, they were kind of red in the mirror and I figured it was because my temperature was very high. I also had a slightly queasy tummy. However there was good news, my throat was feeling much better, probably the same or slightly better as Saturday. My diarrhea was gone but that stuff wasn't fully solid either. While I was in bed I realized how hot I was so I slept with no blankets.

Today my throat feels totally fine and my hair no longer steams when I get out of the shower so I think my fever is gone. It's also around 1pm and I haven't coughed at all. I ran 5 miles but my muscles and bones still kind of ache so I took it easy, other than that I feel normal again. In my experience it took about 5 days from getting the symptoms to getting over them.

3181,"My Current Dilemma As you all know, we are in the middle of a freakin' pandemic. When COVID reaching the USA, my family went into hard lockdown. A few weeks prior my brother had some life-threatening problems and almost passed away. So it has been a hard time since early February. The same brother is high-risk so my family is SUPER cautious about going into the outside world. The first few months were doable and honestly fun because I got to do a lot of spring cleaning, self-reflection, and more. Once it hit summer, I had nothing left to do. I just stayed inside this summer and watched all the people who didn't care about the pandemic have a blast. I grew very angry that people could even have the choice to act like the pandemic is not even a problem. 

By the end of the summer, I fell into a sad and lonely position. This year is my senior year and I have already missed so much. I recently have been feeling extremely tired. Not tired in the sense of sleepiness but tired of the world burning. I am tired of people having parties. I am just so tired of the bullshit. To add to the mess of the quarantine, my brother belittles me and degrades me all the time. Some you are probably thinking, ""It's ok just don't listen to him"". It's hard not to listen when someone says that you are going to grow up to be nothing or you are an embarrassment. I started losing my self-confidence and my love for myself. Life just sucks sometimes. 

Recently my family has been allowing me to do things with friends. My best friend's birthday ising up soon and we have been making plans to do something and it might involve a sleepover. (There are only my 3 friends) Over the last few weeks, I have been thinking about what I want to do. I know I hate myself for even saying this but I want to go. I want to have a good time and be with my friends and actually make some memories and celebrate all our achievements we have done in these last six months. I just feel horrible but I know its wrong yet I want to do anyway. I guess my feelings of wanting to go doesn't change the fact that more than 200,000 Americans have died from COVID already. It also worries me that my school is opening for in person and I will be around them a lot during the day so IDK. 

I am just tired of giving and giving and giving. I giving up so much (friendship, love, memories, etc.) when no one else is giving. I like finishing a pie. If no one else eats their slices, I have to eat more. I have given so much that my mental health is starting to go down too. I find myself thinking the only way to fix my mental health is to see people unsafely, which is horrible. I don't want my brother to say another word to me and I just want normal since I haven't had for so long. I guess I am just stuck with my selfish side and my empathetic side. I guess what I am asking is that, should I go to the sleepover? I feel if I don't go I am just going to grow more and more lonely/depressed. I have talked to them and none of them have done anything except go to the store and essentials but you never know. Am I crazy for thinking this? So many questions. I am sorry it been a hard year for all of us. (I am not trying to say that my problems are more than any else.

3182,"Is loss of smell still a symptom? Going in for another test tomorrow to see if I have this. Last time I tested was three months ago just out of curiosity. I tested negative then. I intend to get tested every three months pretty much. So my next test after this will be a little before or after Christmas.

Backstory first: On Friday night I started to get a headache, woke up Saturday morning with the same headache and mild fever that went away after a few hours. Woke up Sunday morning with similar symptoms but they went away even quicker. Since Sunday night I haven't had any fever like symptoms but my sense of smell isn't as strong as it was a few days ago.

It isn't like my sense of smell ispletely gone. I can still smell really strong stuff, like when I put icy hot on my knees and shoulders after working out. Everything else about me is fine: No fever symptoms, no chest pain, no dry cough, no ""classic"" COVID symptoms, at least not since Sunday night.

Should I expect more/stronger symptoms if I do test positive?

I also have a hunch that I caught this earlier this year. During one weekend in January, I had some pretty intense flu symptoms for a few days. Was sweating bullets even though it was cold outside, needed to keep gallon jugs of water at my bedside to stay hydrated. Had ALL of the ""classic"" COVID symptoms except the dry cough.

Then in March I got a pretty nasty cold and I never get sick during March. It's usually September when I get those kinds of illnesses.

This leads me to believe that what I just got was just me getting my yearly weird illness that I get every September instead of COVID.

3186,"Seeking a little reassurance/encouragement - first outing since March Hi all,

I'm writing this post in the hopes of receiving some support and encouragement from you guys! I'm young and healthy, but I live with a high risk family member I live with, I've been on the very cautious side of things since March, and I've gone in and out of stores/businesses very briefly a handful of times to run errands, but I haven't been inside a building for an extended period of time at all since this all started (weird, when I say it like that). 

Anyway, today I had to brig my car to the mechanic and the people working there/whole interaction took much longer than I expected (20-30 minutes inside a very small room/building. I did everything I could to be safe and everyone in there (about 7 or so people) was wearing masks (except one person who had theirs not covering their nose for a minute or so). I was spaced far from everyone in there with the exception of the cashier who I had to get closer to briefly a few times b/c I couldn't hear him well, and one or two people who walked by me closer than 6 ft. I also wore 2 masks (because paranoia, I know it wasn't necessary). There was also AC on in there, but no open windows or anything.

Now to anyone whoments saying I'm being unreasonable, paranoid, fear mongering by posting my feelings about this interaction--I'mpletely aware, intellectually, that I don't need to worry about this experience. I know I'm being a little ridiculous to stress about that. I realize that people go to work every day in places like this and are totally fine. It's just hard for me, emotionally, to get over the hurdle of doing something like this since I haven't done it in so long. I'm just looking for some reassurance that this is totally fine, and maybe some words offort from people who also struggle with branching out like this! 

Fwiw, I'm in the northeast NJ/NY area, where cases are relatively well controlled but definitely still ocurring (especially recently with outbreaks at parties/beach gatherings/etc.)

I have not seen my boyfriend since March due to my momspromised immune system. I'm terrified of bringing the virus home to her. She is retired and has not gone out. I have been social distancing, only going out when necessary, wear my mask, wear gloves and have groceries delivered. My boyfriend has not been as careful. He hangs out with friends from work, goes to bars, etc. He assures me that he always wears his mask when he goes out.

My boyfriends patience is running thin. About once a month he will drink to much, call me and yell at me for an hour about how we should be able to see each other. He says he will social distance for 2 weeks and get a Covid test just so he can see me. However, even if he does those things I still wouldn't feelfortable and I feel like I would still be taking a huge risk. I've read that  you should only be seeing the people that you live with.

I have been researching on this topic for few days now and i have gotten contradictory answers. To start off my dad is in military and is deployed overseas. Almost a month ago he contacted covid19. Initially everybody at his base tested and he was negative but a week later he started having trouble breathing, had bad body ache, mild fever & cough and lost his sense of smell. He quarantined and recovered within 4-5 days and never got tested but given his symptoms everybody assumed he has contacted it. 
Now the issue is the country he is in right now doesn’t give a fuck. They don’t care if anyone lives or dies and one person from another unit had died a week prior and just two days ago someone from his unit died. I am just extremely worried that he will get reinfected. He wears a mask obviously and they get food in their rooms instead of going to mess to eat but he works with them daily and has to share bathroom as well.

3191,"“Outside” i can’t figure out what’s safe at all I love to ride my bike usually. I live in a big American city and riding my bike has been my main form of transportation for years. Now I share a car with my partner. I want to ride my bike around for exercise and fun but last time I did Im that, 2 people passed me on their bikes w/o a mask, there are people standing on the sidewalk near me, stopped at red lights with others, even people in cars next to me with windows rolled down. I keep hearing that bikes are a great safe way to get exercise and not use public transit, but I wasn’t going to use public transit and the pictures always show someone in like a country rode with no other people. I’ve heard that it’s unlikely to get covid from quick encounters, but I don’t know how to trust it. Should I ride my bike???

Also I’ve had a few instances since moving back here a few weeks ago of seeing a friend and sitting like 10 feet away and sometimes even wearing masks. I feel like they discourage this cause it’s like “well you might get tofortable and get close” or “alcohol might let your guard down!” Or “what if you need to use their bathroom or it starts raining and you wanna go in their house that’s not safe” like DUH. I biked to a friends house 3 miles away to drop something off and it started storming when I was halfway there. I didn’t seek shelter and just rode back through the storm.

3194,"No one is respecting me, my property or my FEELINGS! Rant:  May trigger anger

Sorry for the wall.

I’ve been coping well mentally up until the last couple weeks.  I got very moody, a little depressed, but couldn’t put my finger on it until this morning.  I had a very bad dream last night.  My MIL had thrown a party, hired a small band, was drinking all day, served a ""meal"" that was little more than a snack, etc.  It dragged on for hours.  I am an ex-JW, and the band started singing JW songs!  I lost it, got rough with them, told them nobody here wanted to hear that crap, etc.  Went and got hubby, told him it was time to go NOW!  I went to the spare room where we were supposed to spend the night to get my shoes, and there were piles of clothes everywhere.  I dug though the piles, crap under and on beds, in drawers, and half empty closets, but no shoes, not even any of my belongings!  Turns out hubby, in-laws, and kids were GAMBLING away my belongings!  I am very angry, feel out of control, like no one is respecting me, my property or my FEELINGS!

This has been precipitated by seeing how truly angry I am at Anti-Maskers.  I am at risk of developingplications if I get C19 and have been very careful since mid-March when our governor announced closing schools.  An essential worker whose job can be done 90% from home, I only go in about an hour before most everyone leaves and only 2 – 3 times/week. I don’t go anywhere else.  We already cancelled plans to visit my daughter and family, about 7-hour drive, in May, rescheduling for late July.  Now that may have to be cancelled, and I am very upset over that!  My husband told me they addressed travelling on the news, saying it should be fine if you follow the same precautions you do at home (ie in yourmunity).  Well, how do you follow the same precautions when you rarely go out, and when you do it is to a spacious office where social distancing is easy?

I am fed up that this surge is due to Anti-Maskers and Covid Partiers!  I even read a post on r/MaskSkeptics where someone said they won’t wear a mask because they refuse to continue to have their life dominated by “others’ fears”!  Someone else responded blaming our risk on our lifestyle choices, and said “If they’re so afraid, they can stay home”.  The worst part, I couldn’tment or reply!  I would ask first if they even believe it is real.  Then, if they had a child with asthma, or cancer, or diabetes, would they still blame it on lifestyle choices and would they be willing to wear a mask, do what it takes to protect everyone?  Just because masks are rmended or mandated does not mean that you do not have a choice in the matter.  Each of us chooses how we behave, so don’t blame the existence of guidelines for your feeling of lack of control!  Just be proactive and CHOOSE to protect your fellow citizens, family, and friends!

He is the only person I want to break social distancing for, and I have gotten rather touch starved being holed up with my family for nearly 100 days. I was originally going to ask if it would be safe for me to hug him, as we both have been pretty safe and only going on walks, and I don't know if I can trust myself to *not*  hug him when I see him. We both live fairly close, so we wouldn't have to fly to see each other, and we would be outside, so I know that eliminates some risk, but I am still weary. 

However, that has changed. My town had a small protest last night, in a big area where social distancing was possible, and masks were worn by everyone. I remained socially distanced for the whole time, but my mother did not, and even though we were wearing masks, I am terrified she has gotten it or I have gotten it. I still am seeing my bf in 2 weeks and now I am paranoid that I could be asymptomatic and give it to him. (I strongly believe he doesn't have it, he has been very safe) I was extremely safe up until now, I only have been going on walks at night when less people are around, and my family has gotten groceries delivered, all of which we wipe down with clorox wipes. I was just starting to accept and justify hugging him when I do see him, rather than sitting just 6ft away, because of how safe we have been, but now due to my mother's actions I am severely second guessing that, and am paranoid that if I am asymptomatic, 2 weeks does not seem like a long enough time for it to go away. 

I am extremely mad at my mother, as she knows how paranoid I am, but instead of stopping being close to people, she got mad at me for being worried. My parents say I can't live like this forever and get mad at me when I get paranoid, but I can't control it and I don't know what to do. I realize it seems trivial to be this worried about hugging someone, but I thrive off of physical affection, so I'm sort of desperate at this point, but also I get really paranoid and scared about possible hazards (Just ask anyone I know about the time I got on a ""look up everything about lead paint and how to avoid it"" kick).

I currently live with two other roommates - we get along well, and the quarantine times have been pretty good so far, we've found ourselves a pretty good flow and rhythm of doing both things apart and together.

However - spring is fully breaking out and the parks and flooded with people. One of my roommates has been talking, and now seeing (on distanced walks) a person that they seem very fond of and has expressed ""how difficult, and close to impossible"" it is, and my other roommate has worded that ""it's not possible for me to abstain if this lasts throughout the summer"", meaning that they can't avoid sexual contact if social distancing continues. 

I have not practiced the rules myself - I have continued to see my girlfriend who lives, and isolates by herself (only going out for groceries, and do not get close with anyone else than me). I have had as an excuse for myself that she is alone, and therefore minimises the contact with other people. Perhaps that is only for me to feel better, that I say it put it that way. However, if my roommates would disagree with this arrangement, I would stop seeing my girlfriend no questions asked.

I find it troublesome to know that I break the social distancing rules, and that I am therefore in no position of questioning their choices. However, I do not feelfortable with the thought of them breaking the social distancing rules with 1. a new person that do NOT live alone, and that none of us roommates know of. 2. my other roommate feeling that they need to have sexual encounters, which leaves a lot of parameters out of control.

What can I bring to the table in this discussion? I feel like I'm at a loss on how to approach this matter.",1,0.6,glsa12,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/glsa12/roommates_want_to_break_our_mutually_defined/,8,Support,2020-05-18,-7,91,-0.07692307692307693

3202,"Panic over whether I did something stupid I (35F) live alone and work from home and generally do very low-risk activities. I get all of my groceries delivered, have not seen family in over 3 months, and walk/jog in cemeteries for exercise because no one is there! I'm the person who wears a mask to open packages. I also have panic disorder and am struggling. I have another chronic medical condition that has not been identified as significantly higher-risk, but to be prudent I have mostly acted as though I am in a very high-risk category. I am not overweight, have never smoked, don't drink, and I am a health nut--I eat truckloads of vegetables, exercise, used to run 5ks, mountain climbing, etc. I am also a bundle of nerves even at the best of times and am a recovered anorexic.   


After nearly 7 weeks of lockdown, today I went to my favorite cemetery (yes, I realize how weird that sounds), which is partially a nature preserve, for my daily walk. I brought a mask with me, but was just holding it because no one was around. Not until the very end, when I was going back to my car. One other car was there, a lady I had seen in the distance walking her dog. She was pulling out of the parking area as I was walking to my vehicle. I waved and smiled, and she held up a finger for me to wait. I hesitated and then approached her car, probably standing around 12 feet away. She was very excited and told me about a fox she had seen, which is really cool. She talked to me for about 2-3 minutes, all the time me growing more and more anxious. I stood there like an idiot just holding my mask instead of having it on. I was on the passenger side of her car, and she had only that window partially rolled down as we were talking. I am now terrified I have made the mistake of my life, even though rationally I think this is still fairly low-risk and I live in a rural area where there are not a lot of confirmed cases (50 in my county). There was also a breeze, but then my panic-riddled brain is worrying the breeze blew the virus into my face rather than blowing it away from me. How do I deal with this intense fear? I so badly wanted to have a normal human interaction, as I like talking to people and it's been very tough isolating with zero human contact for nearly 2 months, and I also didn't want to appear rude or too weird if I put on my mask or told her I didn't want to talk to her.

3203,"I think I have the virus or bad allergies or asthma.. or all of itbined. (Rant + support needed please) So basically, I’ve been in the house for 2 months trying my best to only leave if I want to go on a walk every now and then but that is about it. My parents are both essential workers, but as of right now they are fine (thank god). Me on the other hand, for 4 days I’ve been struggling a lot with shortness of breath and a tight chest with some pain every now and then. I get winded by just walking around sometimes and other times I feel a little better. Ites and goes. 

I kept telling myself it was just my seasonal allergies but I’ve never had allergies that have hurt me this badly before. I used to have asthma 10 years ago, but what are the odds of it suddenlying back right now when there’s a virus going around? I don’t know. 

I went to the doctor a few days ago and she said my lungs sound strong and it might just be allergies. I ended up not being able to swallow at some point last night and started to panic so I ended up going to the hospital. They did an xray and my lungs look good so I’m happy for that.. but it could still be the virus and just more mild so it doesn’t show up. This is because they asked me a few times if I wanted to do the test but since it’s so expensive I didn’t want to add more bills to the pile we already have. 

I noticed these symptoms getting worse about 4 days ago and I had McDonald’s 5/6 days ago. I didn’t think it could spread from food because that’s what everyone is saying.. but is it possible? 
As of right now my symptoms are:
-Chest tightness and just feeling full of mucus
- a teeny bit loss of taste but not really. Ites and goes. 
-my temperature has been overall normal but it has gone up to 98-99 a few times and then back down to my regular 96.
-no runny nose, I just sneeze every now and then but I think that’s allergy related. 
-I think I can smell just fine but it might be a little bit less strong for me. 
- I cough but only when I feel like I want to get mucus out, I don’t have to cough 24/7. 

That’s it. Even the doctors aren’t sure because they think it could be asthma, allergies, the virus, acute bronchitis.. list goes on. Does anyone else have similar symptoms or can relate? Idk what’s going on with my body but I’m trying really hard to just relax and let it happen. Stress only makes it harder on me.

3204,"Terrified of getting the virus Hi, just made this account since I deleted my older one a few years ago.

As most of you probably relate with, I'm having some severe anxiety about the virus. I have taken time off from my job (Dunkin') indefinitely until all of this blows over; I have 2 infant siblings, one whom has underdeveloped lungs, so if I were to take this virus home I would be screwed, and so would they. I want to protect them and my family desperately.

I've had very very little contact with the outside for the past couple weeks, only time I've left my house was today to go put air into my tire so it wouldn't deflate while I'm sitting here in quarantine, also went out to get a coffee for my mother and I to make her day a little better (obviously wore gloves and all of that). I practice perfect hygiene all the time in an attempt to minimize any chance of getting the virus.

However, about 30 minutes ago I had bad stomach pains, used the bathroom, washed my hands and decided to take my temperature since I've been super paranoid about that. Only made my anxiety worse because my temperature right now is hovering around 99.5-99.9 degrees and I don't know how to feel about this. I don't feel sick at all besides that stomach pain I had, now gone, I think it was because of some of the food I ate earlier.

I've had some run-ins in the past couple weeks with false alarm low-grade fevers, only mostly because I was most likely dehydrated, or something else like that  but I just can't help be absolutely terrified when I read a number like that, I'm just sitting here so scared.",1,0.6,g40910,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g40910/terrified_of_getting_the_virus/,4,Support,2020-04-19,-12,88,-0.13636363636363635

3213,"Life lived in 14-day increments Here I go again. Another 14-day count.

Someone either sneezed or coughed within 6 feet of me this morning. It was done quickly and delicately, so I can't tell whether it was a sneeze or a cough. I believe she was wearing a mask.

It was my fault. My vision was a littlepromised by my mask positioning. Plus it was early, no coffee yet. Excuses. I failed to notice her until it was too late, so we crossed paths in a parking lot.

Which is worse, a sneeze or a cough? Sneezes scare me because they're more forceful, so I assume they spread more virus..*.if* the sneezing person has Covid. Coughs scare me because I am more likely to fear it's a possible Covid-19 symptom. I have no idea which to hope this shopper's polite hiccup was.

For my 2 ""strangers' sneezes"" to date, or after I make my own stupid face-touching type of mistakes or whatever, I start counting my ""14 days"" until I tell myself that I won't get sick from that incident.

I'm not talking about confirmed exposures or being asked to quarantine or to note into work. I have lived very cautiously since March. I know that we can't all realistically self-quarantine after each and every absentmindedly resolved booger situation. Yet, my whole life has been lived in these 14-day mental segments for months now.

I am very grateful that I have not been sick, so far. And I am aware that if I ever do get sick, it isn't necessarily logical to blame some event that I had spent the previous 2 weeks worrying about, because something or someone else might have made me sick, and I will probably never know.

I'm afraid the act of waving at someone and saying hello is going to be something that's looked down upon, and that a hug is going to be akin to assaulting someone, and that friends and family will abandon one another using ""Social Distancing"" as an excuse, that no one will take the time and be kind to people.

I've always been more of a homebody, so the past 3 months have been mostly me staying inside playing video games. 

That said, I'm tired of the lockdown. I'm tired of being lectured by people on Twitter and Reddit about how I just want to kill Grandma to hang out with some friends. I'm tired of hearing statistic after statistic of cases going up and how we need to shut down again.  

I missed seeing my friends during this pandemic, and Discord and zoom can only provide so muchpanionship. My church has been hosting in person Bible studies for about two weeks, and I love it. My friends and I have been meeting for movie nights and it feels so good to be with people other than my family. For a while, it seemed things would be going back to normal. Even if it meant having to adjust to the ""new normal"" of wearing masks and keeping a distance, I was ready to have a life again.

But now, it looks like that'lle to an end. People are panicking again, demanding to go back into lockdown, and demanding that people who don'tply be fined or even arrested.

I went into self-quarantine on the 12th. I advocated on social media that early closures were necessary. Things were fine for me for a few days.

Then around 5 days later started my breaking. I had seen my girlfriend in private the other day (we took the most precautions we could, not using public transport, staying away from others), and we still wanted to see each other in person again. But her mom didn't agree to letting her daughter see anyone indefinitely. I started to just...break down, my depression and anxiety catching up to me. I asked my girlfriend constantly over this past week if she could get her mom to let us meet.

3222,"I've had zero social life since the first case of coronavirus here in Vancouver in Jan 27, at ""voluntary"" social distancing at the demand of my parents. I don't know how much longer I can take. This is going to be as much about my unhealthy relationship with my parents/living situation as the actual outbreak itself. I am going to try to not make this political so please don't make it political (think that's not what this subreddit is about anyways).

We are from China, but I've been a Canadian citizen for over 20 years and I actually haven't visited China for over 2 years. I am just over 30 but I am sure many of you would understand that I am still living at home since I am not married. I've actually lived on my own for 3 and a half years when I worked away, but have since moved back in when I transferred back to Vancouver, and never really enjoyed living under my parent's roof. Its very much ""their"" house even though I have joint ownership of it. 

My mom worked in public health in the past and still has friends in that sector. She has WeChat groups with people who are still actively working, so she claims she gets accurate information. Unfortunately from what I can see, the misinformation is just as rampant. She claims that she has never seen an outbreak that warranted a city lock down since shes been born, and that's why it needs to be taken seriously.

I had plans to go out on Jan 27. The evening of Jan 26 was when local misinformation started circulating, and a local city councillor posted rumours of a person who called her saying they were discharged from hospital here, went back to Shanghai, and got diagnosed with coronavirus. Parents panicked, they told me to cancel my plans, don't go to restaurant, public place, etc. I said I am still going to work, how can I even hide from this, and I never thought there's no cases here anyways, but the risk is low so why the heck are you demanding this of me. Nevertheless, the shouting match ended in me canceling my plans and agreeing to stay home. It angered me further when the rumours were false the next day, but Vancouver did announce its real first presumptive case. The beginning of social distancing that day also meant that I watched the Superbowl at home a few days later, instead of going out, having fun. A few days later they furthered the demand to avoid more public places like the gym. 

We had more fights over the next month, I said I'll stay home and appease them, but if there are no local cases for 2 weeks I am ending the madness. Unfortunately, every week here would be one case that trickles in and ruins my count. I'd have more fights about them listening to misinformation, panicking for no reason, not following local guidelines, not trusting local health officials. They'd say I am naïve, don't know how to protect myself, protect my family, etc.

The thing that doesn't make sense is that I go to work full time. I am a pharmacist myself and have peers who are by no means stupid. I see the panic buying that has ransacked our shelves of hand sanitizers, rubbing alcohol, and gloves. We haven't had masks since Jan 20 ish, for some reason that's not been in good supply since the flu season of 2018. I see that if there is an outbreak, there's almost NO way that I can avoid it being in the position that I am in, all I have is my own immune system and the hope that I am one of the 80% mild symptoms. Avoiding restaurants and social outings seems to be a negligible effort to me, and it has killed me emotionally. Meanwhile I am hearing about my friends going out, there are still events going on around to attend, like the 10 year Olympics anniversary, there was a WWE televised event, Wetsuwet protests (HA), none of which I can attend but I see tons of people going, and I am sitting at home after work doing pretty much nothing, and yet somehow that's supposed to protect me when I go to work with NO protective equipment and would be called an idiot for wanting to put on protective equipment. We've also had countless fights about stop trying to hunt for masks, I've read countless sources that they don't work, and finally I found a report on one of the coronavirus subs that say they do.

They claim that nobody is putting chains on me to force me to stay home. I wonder if anyone would even understand the moral chains and guild tripping Asian parents can put on you... 

Its embarrassing when friends joke about it being ""house arrest"". Its embarrassing when people at work ask me what I've been doing my days off and I say ""nothing"". Its embarrassing when I seem to be the nut swimming in misinformation and panic. But I also do know the seriousness of this outbreak, entire provinces and countries even wont be quarantined if it wasn't serious. I am still going to work, healthy, its better than being stuck in a tiny cabin afloat on one of the cruise ships, being refused entry and help from multiple governments around the world.

But it just makes my blood boil wondering wtf I've been doing the last 6 weeks. It makes my blood boil thinking about the last 5 or 6 weeks of my life that I'll never get back way BEFORE the situation here got serious. I have way more scattered thoughts that I don't even know to post in this one message that might stille to mind later. Are my friends who are still going out and having fun the idiots? Or are we the idiot for staying home and freaking out way before the outbreak gets here? I don't even know...

Meanwhile, perhaps its right to do my part to protect the parents (as much as I hate them), and prevent the drama that's sure to ensue if I did catch it, protect the idiots I work with, protect the patients I interact with, etc...

I ordered a box of nitrile gloves from Amazon (they're pretty hard to get now, but I was able to order a box last week). They were out for shipment by UPS today and supposedly delivered at ~1pm. I'm 99% certain that the package was stolen by the driver or someone else in the distribution chain, because I was home all day and it never showed up. No picture proof, my neighbor usually sees the truck when it goes by, and it wasn't at any of my neighbor's doorsteps. My mom told me that her friend had a shipment of masks stolen.

Another friend of mine works at an industrial chemicalpany and said they've had to suspend all shipments and deliver directory (with no courier) to hospitals (disinfectant, sanitizers) because deliveries are getting intercepted. He said the delivery workers are desperate too since they're also on the front line and thepanies they work for can't get enough to protect them.

This is so vile. I'm fine with losing my shipment, I'll survive...but is this what we'vee to?

Edit for clarity: I already called UPS. They contacted the driver, who swore that he delivered it. I don't actually think this happened. I was home all day and my dog and the neighbor's dog will get riled up if someone even walks up to the door without knocking. Furthermore, I'm not calling out all delivery employees.

3236,"We Have A Date For When Life Can Return to Normality I'm so, so happy. A few days ago, the CDC [announced]( that in July of 2021, most Americans will have been given the COVID-19 vaccine. It's a known fact that in order for life to return to normal, we need the vaccine to be given to all Americans and, for lack of a better word, Earthlings (disregarding those who can't get the vaccine because of immunodeficiencies/conspiracy theories about microchips and ThE mArK oF tHe BeAsT). 10 months, huh. I can do that. It will suck, but I can do that.

At the moment, I'm 14 (my birthday was on September 7) and in eighth grade. This quarantine hasn't been fun for me. I'm a closet trans-girl, and I deal with several mental health issues (thanatophobia, OCD, Asperger's, depression, nightmare disorders, et cetera), and those variables don't mix well with having to socially isolate to ensure I don't spread SARS-COV-2, and by extension, COVID-19 to more vulnerable peoples.

Part of me worries I'll have to socially isolate forever (OCD). I'm [worried that perhaps the conspiracy theories are true, and I am just a pawn in a Satanic psychological experiment]( Sometimes I worry that this virus will be the permanent pandemic and I have to live with my entire social, sexual, and careerical life being taken away from me before it can even truly begin. I know it's bullshit (what motivation would people have for keeping us inside all the time, and no pandemic has been permanent, not even in the medical dark ages.) but it's still scary.

Most of all, I miss the social interaction of school. I miss seeing girls. The way they dress, the way they act (convivially and affectionately.) Being a closet trans girl, it was reallyforting and consultatory. Now the only body I look at is my filthy, fat hairy body that in no way resembles the feminine body I'd desire. I'm thinking if the rates of COVID-19 are below 1% (they're at 3% right now) when the new semester begins, I'll return to school.

And as more people get vaccinated, the more aspects of normal life that can return. But by July, all of normal life will return. Yes, the economy and culture will be damaged for the rest of my life, but at least those are issues we can hug it out with, right?

3242,"I Feel Conflicted. Hello everyone. I hope you're all doing well and staying safe.

I'm feeling conflicted. Since the beginning of this pandemic, my state has been the critical thinking equivalent of a house fire that the residents are just ignoring. It was, and still is, morbidly fascinating.

Cases are still spiking here because we just went full YeYe and dove right into pretending we beat Covid19. I actually find myself laughing because what else can I do? Crying makes my face swell up. 

Since the whole state just kinda... Became a cluster fuck... I gave up on social distancing. I, along with the elderly person I lived with, were the only ones actually following directions that we knew. We both became stressed, sad, and unhappy. I missed my boyfriend and she missed her kids and grandkids. We did this for months and we finally broke and said ""if no one else is even attempting to social distance, how the hell are we going to make a difference?"" So, we decided to start seeing our closest loved ones again. We are also both working. 

I'll be honest with you guys... It put us both under pressure I was not prepared for and I did not expect. I had nightmares a lot... Couldn't sleep well, otherwise, on top of that. I stopped eating and lost a lot of weight. I was mourning, almost. I started an antidepressant, and that helped. But I knew, still, that the constant separation was doing damage to my life that I needed to repair. But I couldn't repair it without giving up social distancing. So, I gave it up. 

I have been working very hard to fix up my new house with my boyfriend as we are moving in together this year. I want a home to go home to. A place to cook, relax, and feel safe. 

I have only seen family and my boyfriend outside of work (with the exception of one person who came to pick up a package and stayed 12 feet away from me). I've kept my mask on at all times at work (only taking it down to drink coffee so I don't pass out since I have given up eating at work, now). I always wear a mask in public and my boyfriend is wearing a mask as well, too. He is also only seeing family. He saw his close friend and her daughter at an outside thing a week ago for her birthday and that was probably the most extreme thing he has done in literally months, although I don't know if masks were used to be honest.

None of us have gone to giant house parties, clubs, bars, etc. I have purposely been keeping my distance from people asking to hang out because I can see that they've been to hot spots to party and have been going out, unmasked or hanging out in large groups with others who aren't doing anything to protect themselves or others. 

But while I am trying to build my little life in my corner of the county, I look around at the people who just kinda... Don't care. Sure, more people are wearing masks in stores, but they're still going to the beach, eating in restaurants, going to bars and clubs... I'm glad they're at least covering their face in stores, but they are still going to places of high transmittal without masks and whatnot. 

I can't help but feel torn because on one hand, I'm not social distancing anymore due to not really being able to in part because of my job (which I love, I'm notplaining!) and because I was the only person I knew doing it. But on the other hand, I see the spikes and dumbassery around me and I feel responsible, in some way. 

I feel like a bad person. I feel like a selfish person. I'm also scared to go back to hiding in my house,pletely cut off from my loved ones again. I'm afraid of what that will do to me, my health, my ability to work well, my life... My relationships. How much am I supposed to sacrifice when no one else is? 

Do I not deserve to be happy, too? To build the life that so few of us are lucky enough to have? Am I supposed to simply pass up this rare opportunity for the sake of people who wouldn't spit on me to put out flames? 

My grandmother knows she's in the higher risk group because of age, not health, but she doesn't want to be cut off from her family anymore. It was very hard for her. Very hard. She chose her kids and grandkids over fear of infection. Does that make her a bad person, too? 

What is going on, here?

3243,"I’m losing feelings for my SO amidst social distancing. Is this normal? So this is somewhat a relationship question, but I am curious if anyone here is experiencing the same thing.

For a bit of background my SO and I were duscussing the possibility of marriage back in February (we’ve been dating for almost 3 years) and I was feeling pretty good about our relationship at that point. We do not live together so when the shut down started I was feeling extremely anxious, worrying “What happens if one of us gets sick and we never get to see each other again?” I was also determined to isolate no matter what.

Making it worse was the fact that my SO was not taking it seriously in the beginning and he was continuing to go to work and go to the store as usual, even acting hurt that I would not see him when I was only avoiding him to keep him safe. Eventually I reached a breaking point where I thought “You know what, he won’t listen to me no matter what I say. If he gets sick that’s on him and I just have to let it go.” I started to feel a bit numb emotionally.

Then I went through a phase where I felt used to “the new normal”, stopped feeling so anxious about the virus, decided to be less strict about no contact and going for an outdoor walk once a week with my SO. Basically I stopped giving a fuck to some extent.

Currently we’ve been discussing the possibility of having physical contact in May some time, so long as we are both feeling well and have both been adhering to social distancing as best we can. Meanwhile I have suddenly reached a phase where I have no interest in my SO whatsoever and am feeling a bit repulsed by him or something. So basically I’ve gone from being terrified of losing him to indifferent, to suddenly and inexplicably losing feelings for him all together. 

It’s probably worth noting that I suffer from anxiety and depression and I have had doubts about our relationship in the past, but I was very happy with our relationship before all this started. Is it possible that this is a side effect of social distancing or a defense mechanism? Have any of you been experiencing this in your relationships?

Health care workers are dying from this virus and all they ask is for us to stay home. Seems like a sacrifice I can make for a few months.

3258,"Mother's uing surgery (Nov) - UGH! Hi, all..my 77 year old Mother told us today she's going to go ahead with a surgery in November, at a hospital in the county that has the 4th highest # of daily cases in our state.  She has to get a COVID test before going, but I'm very concerned about what she might get exposed to in the 3 days that she'll be there.  Also equally concerned about how to care for her after the surgery - she needs 3 days of 24x7 care, and has asked wife and I (since we're both retired) if we can do it.  Mom also lives 4 hours away, so we'd need to drive up there and pretty much stay with her that whole time - which is LOTS of potential exposure.

We haven't been inside a business with one exception (urgent Dental appointment to investigate a cavity that could have gotten worse and required either a root canal and/or extraction) since March.  Grocery pickup and delivery only.  Haven't even gone to our favorite bike trails or parks more than a couple of times since then, and wore our masks when we did.  Basically, we're all but 100% quarantined and taking every precaution including wearing our masks anytime we go outside of our house.

The surgery is technically elective, but something she's doing to alleviate some pretty severe back pain she's been dealing with for almost a year now.  I'm obviously not the one who has to deal with the pain, but when I heard this, the first thing I thought was ""Fauci and others have said fall and winter are going to be the worst for COVID - and that's probably the WORST POSSIBLE TIME anyone can expose themselves to a hospital for 3 days..can't you put it off till Spring?""

I feel like aplete and total shithead, but my first reaction (selfishly) was that there's no way we can risk spending 3 days indoors with someone who may have been exposed to COVID while spending the prior 3 days in a hospital.  We're both > 50, both have co-morbidities and COVID could easily kill one or both of us if we were ever exposed.  That's why we've been so incredibly careful.  But how do I turn down my OWN MOM who needs our help?  Didn't she risk her OWN life to bring me into the world?

My first reaction was to tell wife that I'd pay for 3 days of 24x7 care for her from a local nurse or similar carekeeper.  But to have to say ""sorry..we just can't risk it"" is really, REALLY stressing the crap out of me, because it seems totally andpletely selfish (OK, IS totally andpletely selfish).  But I can't risk wife's or my own life, either, to be exposed for 72+ hours to someone who could have picked up COVID while in hospital and in all likelihood given the timing (care immediately after her 3 days in the hospital) would not even be showing symptoms if she DID get exposed.

3261,"Keep trying to make plans but no one seems interested Hi reddit. This is my first post. I'm writing because I just needed a place to express my feeling of isolation with COVID.

I (25F) have a group of friends from work that are pretty tight, but we all work from home due to COVID. I try to make plans with them pretty much every weekend, but no one seems interested. I try to suggest different things (going out for some reasonably safe outdoor dining or drinks, a movie night, etc). They often glaze over it in the group text, people continue talking without acknowledging that I'd brought up trying to hang out. Most of them have kids and spouses so I know they're busy and try not to take it personally. I do get self conscious that it's just that they don't like me, but I really don't think that's it - they just are mostly introverts, we live a good bit apart, and are busy adults. I also don't think it's about COVID - because we do see each other sometimes and just from what I know about them, I know it's not that.

I only have 2 other friends (not part of that group) that I talk to often, and I try to link up with them but the same kind of thing happens where they're busy and our schedules don't line up.

I do see these friends occasionally, and I'm lucky to live with my S/O so I'm not totally alone. I also see my immediate family fairly often. And I started a new grad school program and am getting to know folks there, but of course its all online due to COVID so that kinda sucks socially too. I was particularly excited to start school because I was excited to make more friends and have more people to hang out and do things with.

I lost my best friend a couple of years ago (we had a huge falling out) and I feel like since then, I've been trying and trying to build up healthy, mutually reciprocated friendships, but it's so hard to make and see friends as an adult. COVID is making it all so hard because I'm just home all the time. I know I'm luckypared to lots of people who live alone or have no family or friends, but I'm also trying to keep in mind that it's not the Grief Olympics and allow myself to feel sad about this.

What would you make of this? Has anyone else struggled with adult friendships like this? Am I expecting too much? I don't want to tell them I feel this way, I'd be embarrassed :/

TL;DR: I think my friends do genuinely like me, but they don't seem to want to hang out nearly as often as I would like and it makes me feel really rejected.

To say 'fuck it, these people don't care about me, why should I care about them'. My partner and I live alone and are young, we'd be taking the immediate risk only on ourselves if we decided to go to the gym or not cancel our travel plans for September.

As an extrovert with anxiety and depression, the idea of only going to the grocery store for 18 months and especially not having any travel or events to look forward to makes me feel so defeated and hollow. Looking at the news, it feels like that's going to be required.

I won't give in and be selfish. But it's tempting right now, and the mathematics, the back and forth, feel like they're constantly taking up space in my head. I can't stop reading headlines and trying to time travel, bouncing back and forth between virus fears and social fears. I guess I'm asking if anyone has any advice for how to calm down and forgive myself for having these feelings and impulses even if I won't follow through.",2,0.67,h8glfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/h8glfn/struggling_with_feeling_selfish/,6,Support,2020-06-14,-7,68,-0.10294117647058823
3267,"Friend keeping her son in anxious state My friend is extremely vulnerable.  Five years ago she received a double lung transplant (she is 59). She is in excellent health now, but the virus would probably kill her. She has a 16-yr-old son who is my 17-yr-old son's best friend. We are both single moms and despite differing parenting styles overall (she's strict, I'm not), we love and respect each other and love that our boys are friends. The problem: I keep wishing she would allow her son to live in a household that doesn't require such extreme precautions, for the summer.

She has a sister who lives nearby who could be his caretaker, and of course I have offered, too. Her boy is having to live such a restricted lifestyle, it worries me. I understand it would be very hard for her to not have him near, but it doesn't seem fair to him. She does have supportive friends (including me) and is a very independent person who can take care of herself without his help.

If he were allowed to live away from her this summer, he could work an outdoor job with my son and enjoy lots of activities he can't enjoy now. We live in a rural area that is relatively low risk, but because of herpromised condition, she has to stay quarantined, and has to keep clear restrictions on her son's lifestyle. None of her restrictions are unrealistic, and I'm glad she is protecting herself, but I don't like that her son is having to live in constant anxiety over contaminating her. My son tells me that his friend feels trapped and miserable.

On the other hand, she's his mom, and it's really not my place to say what is right for him.

I've talked with my friend, and although she hates the situation and feels sad that her son has to be so careful living with her, she doesn't want to let him go.

3269,"I'm deeply worried about how the schools reopen for my own safety. For geographical context, I live in Ireland, we don't really have that many cases, well, relatively. 25k currently but the numbers are under control. I'm mainly worried about how the schools reopen. We haven't been told how schools are going to reopen aside from them reopening in September, we don't know how (or if) they are going to social distance, enforce face masks, how children at risk will be treated, any of it, and I don't know how to contact them to ask. Now, for the average kid, schools reopening will be fine. But this is a personal anecdote. So don't take this as me saying that reopening them is dangerous for everyone.

Alright, so. I have asthma, if I get it I'll probably at minimal be in intense agony and at worst be in a coffin. My mother has asthma, is in her 40s and is also quite obese. If she gets it I'm certain she will die or at least the virus will have a lasting impact on her body. We live in the same, stuffy, generally unhealthy house. We don't have a car and she's too lazy to walk usually so we have our grandmother drive us to the grocery shops. She's in her 60s and has high blood pressure that she is currently taking medication for. If she gets it, it'll fuck her up at least. My grandmother is also the only one interacting with and getting groceries for my great grandmother. She's in her 80s, self explanatory there.

Overall, me getting it sets off a domino effect leaving 3 people dead and me an orphan having to be taken in by one of my aunts that I don't really know all that well if they even have the room to fit me at all, and the most likely place I'd get it is in my cramped, small and 100+ pupil school. 

Most of the kids there are relatively healthy. If they get it they'll probably be asymptomatic or only have slight symptoms. The locker areas especially are very cramped, even if you decrease social distancing guidelines to 1m instead of 2m it'd be virtually impossible, provided that they even attempt to keep to the guidelines, considering that even 1m distancing would cover near half the corridor where a lot of other classes are also lining up to go into their classrooms, let alone 2m distancing.

So, in closing, am I fucked? I don't really see any reason to be not anxious about it. Even if transmission rates between children and parents are low there's still the chance of it especially considering me and my mother and grandmother are in close contact a lot. And, while I don't know the transmission rates for child to child, I doubt it's all that promising.",2,0.6,gramg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gramg9/im_deeply_worried_about_how_the_schools_reopen/,11,Support,2020-05-27,-18,137,-0.13138686131386862

3278,"Went to the ER last night. I had to go to the emergency room for the first time in my life last night due to severe pelvic/abdominal pain. It was so bad I couldn't sit or lie down to sleep, and I knew if I didn't get help I'd be in trouble.

The waiting room was closed and I was alone other than the nurse behind the desk. I wore a mask and gloves, but had to take the gloves off when they took a urine sample. When I finally got home after some instructions and a painkiller shot, I sanitized my hands/arms with an 80% alcohol sanitizer, wiped my phone with disinfectant, and changed my clothes. 

I'm 23... not the *healthiest,* but things could be far worse, I suppose. I'm trying to get more sun exposure so I can up my vitamin D levels, because I'm pretty sure I'm deficient. I've also lost about a pound a day for a little over a week, and while I certainly can lose weight faster than most thanks to being overweight, if you know anything about weight loss, you know that's probably mostly water. Lo and behold, they told me I was dehydrated, so I think I need to get on that too.

I'm feeling much better and my pain is mostly gone, so I feel kind of stupid having gone in. The wing I was in was basically totally empty and I was apparently one of two people who had been in that night at all.

The nurse who gave me the shot asked me about my hands and I told him it was from obsessivepulsive disorder related handwashing. He told me people are overreacting to the virus, basically. I don't know if he really believes that, or if he was just taking note of me having OCD and trying to calm me down.

I'm scared, honestly. I'm not totally freaking out yet, but I'm afraid I just sentenced myself to catching COVID because I needed help with the abdominal pain.

3286,"A little break from the worry and anxiety... I have never had more anxiety than now, at this unprecedented time in our history. In the first week or so of quarantine, I felt that my anxiety would not stop until this was over. And when would that be? Two, three months from now?! How could I bare to wake up every day knowing I would have feelings of hopelessness and helplessness every waking minute. I worry about my parents, who still go to stores when they need something. I worry about my boyfriend, who has an autoimmune disorder. I worry about his parents and grandparents. It is all too much. 

But I found a saving grace, and a way to get rid of all of the noise, even just for an hour - YOGA AND MEDITATION. 

Maybe some of you have started this during quarantine too, and maybe some of you are thinking about it. So I am here to say that it has not only helped me escape for a short period of time in the day, but it has actually helped my anxiety even after class is over. I never thought it would, but after three straight days, I feel a little more at peace with myself. 

Don't get me wrong, I still worry, and this is not a cure all for anxiety, but the high levels of panic have subsided for the most part. I can't say this is all attributed to the classes, but I know they are part of it! 

So, if you can, go online and see what classes are being offered virtually. Many instructors are hosting free classes, and others at very low price. It gives you some social interaction (even if you don't turn your camera on like me) and gives your mind and body a rest.

3294,"What are psychological reasons for people to gather during this pandemic? Hi. I am putting this question out there because I want to understand the mindset of people who seem to behave as if there wasn't a world-wide and potentially deadly pandemic out there.

**Please do NOT reply with any anger or hate or judgement!**

Please keep it a polite and emotionally detached discussion for research purposes.

**Anything with psychological background is preferred.**

**TLDR:**

I see reports of people flooding beaches and bars. And I see the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise (in part as a result of gatherings).

I understand why some states feel pressured to re-open (mostly economic reasons, I hope).

What I don't understand is why people would insist on performing non-essential group activities that are very clearly dangerous during a pandemic.

I also want to understand why people who are ""young and strong and likely to be fine if infected"" do not think one step further about how it's not just about them but also about their families (especially the elderly) and co-workers who can be infected by them.

I'd like to see some psychological ideas that might help me explain this.

Again, no flaming - I seriously want to understand this.

**More background in case you're interested:**

Already in early March, my wife and I looked at the facts and decided to hunker down. We took one last shopping trip (nothing too excessive since we didn't want to take from others) mid-March, and that was it. We rarely leave the house, and we feel quite confident that we will not get infected or infect others (we would not want that on our conscience).

But then last month, a band I know announced that they might consider playing in the outside courtyard of a retirementmunity (the most vulnerable and most effectedmunity type), and they asked if I wanted to play with them. I very strongly declined and gave my reasons. Personally, I don't think anything of this sort will be safe until maybe next year if we're lucky.

And today I received a notification that two music venues in my area are opening up again - this involves multiple people on stage, spectators, and even dancers. I cannot see how they could possibly have any kind of social distancing, and I am not certain the venues will enforce any capacity limits (in many cases, opening under capacity is not financially worth the effort).

I am having a hard time with all of this. It shakes my confidence in my own judgement. I have a bit of a background in science and biology, and the facts I continue to research make sense to me (even as some of the facts change which is normal in science).

Because of that, staying home also makes sense to me. But seeing so many people that appear to be disregarding all the facts and warnings is confusing and alarming to me. It makes me wonder if I ampletely wrong and if all the facts are wrong. My brain is having trouble believing in myself when there is my word against that of thousands of people.

So I am trying to understand what drives people to do this.

Please discuss politely.

3295,"Please help me if you can. I'm not doing great. ***Important Preface****: I talk about intrusive suicidal thoughts I've been having in this post, and I describe a pessimistic perspective on my future during the pandemic. I totally understand that this can be harmful to others. Please, if you think that could trigger anxiety or upset you in any way, don't read this. Stay safe!*

Hey guys. This is a sequel of sorts from a post I made a few days ago. That day, I was feeling really anxious and entering an ufortable state of thinking. As of today, it hasn’t gotten much better, and I don’t know if it will for a long time.

At this state in the pandemic, my mind’s pretty torn up by everything, and as of the past few days, I’ve been considering my future should things go worst-case. Here’s the thing: like many, my brain’s very sensitive and is struggling to cope with the possibilities of COVID-19. The main thing that’s got me distraught is the idea of losing parents/siblings in the midst of this. 

I’ve seen plenty of stories crammed in my face where a person’s lost various family members to the virus (some young, some old, some with underlying conditions, some with none). I’ve seen absolutely heartbreaking, first-hand accounts on Reddit of people losing family. These stories are bing toomon, and I just have a feeling it’s heading my way. At this point, there’s no guarantee that my family and I will get out of this unscathed, and until there is, I simply cannot assume an optimistic mentality. This could change as we get further into this, but as of now, I just don’t think it’s possible.

With that, the worst-case scenario has been incredibly overwhelming in my head, and I’ve been having suicidal thoughts entering my thoughts, which is inplete contrast to where my mental health was just a few weeks ago. I can’t imagine continuing forward, at the age of 20 in my college years, and dealing with the loss of a parent or sibling in the process. I totally understand we’re not guaranteed tomorrow, and I could be dealing with this situation at any time, but that’s typically not so prevailing in my everyday life.

This fucking pandemic has put that possibility in the front seat, and like a lot of people, losing my parents or siblings this early on is my biggest fear. Growing up, I always did everything to ensure I knew they were safe where they were, whether they were travelling, at work, or just in another room at home.

God, I’m absolutely bawling my eyes out just typing this.

I get that humans are resilient, and that we (usually) find a way in every situation, no matter how devastating, **but I don’t think that’d cut it for me**. I don’t think I could deal with the pain. I’m doing really bad already – before anything’s even happened – and if that ends up being reality, I think that’d be it for me. I just can’t imagine living it – I’m too fragile.

I really, really want a future with my parents where THIS VIRUS isn’t what takes them from me. 

I know all of us do. 

I want them to continue enjoying their lives, too, whether that’s seeing their kids or grand-kids, watching football, fishing on weekends and more. The thought of an empty living space with all their possessions and interests collecting dust because of their death from this fucking virus is already too much for me to cope with. I’m really struggling here. I actually had a panic attack just writing that.

I’ve voiced these concerns to my mom, and told her I was starting to have intrusive suicidal thinking, and honestly -- while I absolutely understood and respected it -- her response didn’t help me too much. It just felt nice to get it out.

 I don’t know what can help me. I’m just heartbroken that I’m even thinking about an early ending if things go that way; it's in absolute contrast with the love for life I had just a few weeks ago. I’m also that my parents – who are at a beautiful point in their lives, could be taken away so soon.

I don't think mourning them before anything's even happened is a good thing. It's unhealthy and unfounded mental preparation. I'm starting to understand that a little more.

**Again, I totally understand death is inevitable; we’ll all encounter it at some point, unfortunately**. But the fact it’s just thrown at us like this is so painful. Please, if you have anything reassuring to offer, I’d really appreciate hearing it. I hope this didn’te off as selfish. I just don’t know what to do right now. I’m feeling hopeless, and I needed a place to let it out.

3296,"I Do Not Like Fatherhood and Now That’s All I Do As a disclaimer. I love my kids; I feel feelings of protection and a strong desire for them to live good and happy lives. I just don’t enjoy the act of fatherhood. I haven’t since the day my first child was born 11 years ago. I have moments of glimpses of what I think is the joy or contentment in the act of fatherhood that I understand other fathers experience on a regular basis but those feelings are fleeting and not a significant part of my life.  They sometimes feel a little shocking when they happen to me (maybe once or twice a year?) and mainly serve as a reminder that I don’t get to experience them very often.

I’ve read books, I’ve gone to therapy, I tried psychological exercises, I have tried to train myself to like something that I don’t like but as far as I can see that’s just the way I am wired and if I didn’t change in 11 years I’m not expecting it to change in the future.

11 years is a very long time to do something that you deeply dislike the experience of, but I firmly believe that I have a duty to raise children that I brought into this world so I have been doing my best for the last 11 years.

By most outward standards others seem to think me a good father. Other Dads and Momsplement me, I don’t use corporal punishment, I’m very affectionate and I rarely yell.  One kid has anger management issues and she is in therapy for that but the other seems to be well-adjusted.  Both kids are doing well at school. 

But that is the outward external world.  The internal personal experience of parenthood is a slog for me.  A long long largely joyless slog (even the allegedly fun part are not fun for me) that I do my best to push through with feelings of duty and obligation.

As such, I was very happy when the kids finally went to school, and I tried to get my kids to be involved in many activities, both because I think that is good for them, but also to give myself a break from my struggle.

And now all that’s taken away from me. Now during my “work day” my kids are fighting with each other constantly and me and my wife are trying to get them to stop and do their schoolwork while trying to keep telmute jobs and then when the workday is done, there’s no escape.  No end. The kids are incredibly bored at that point and starved of social contact so I need to be there for them.  And then by the time they go to bed, I have maybe an hour in which we do the never ending stream of chores, and then I go to sleep and it starts all over again.

•make your bed

• be creative right away, for as long as you can  (I write, but anything will do, cook a healthy breakfast maybe.) 

• eat a easy healthy breakfast; light protein and lots of veggies, 4 servings of fruit or veggies.

• Do a body weight exercise for 15- 30mins,  gym memberships are a money pit anyway. (Look on YouTube, I do a ""Yoga Dose"" then a ""OfficialThenX"" work out myself)

• you daily morning hygiene routine by 9am; shower, shave, so on. (I do about 7am)

•Work hard at something, anything, from 8-12. (Might try learning or major home improvement if you can't work.)

• Set a alarm to drink a glass of water every hour or so, it's just good for you.

•try to get 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day.

• look up your body weight and figure out how much water you're supposed to take in, then try to do that every day with little tiny reminders here and there to drink.

• Only buy healthy snacks; pears, apples, nuts bananas. You'll eat junk if it's there.

• Eat a very light lunch, half salad or vegetarian soup. Say 2-4 servings of fruit and veggies.

•The walk out in the sun for a 10-15 minutes after lunch, (no sunglasses, light fights minor depression from being shut in).

• spend about a half-hour to a hour light reading every day; magazine, fun novel, so on. (Backpacker magazine, Orion magazine, or the Cincinnati Review is my go to)

•Get back to work if you can for 3 hours. If you can't work from home, tinker or learn something new... you might try learning yoga or oil painting

• TV is the enemy (it eats your day, but also your reality in someway... Everything is just going through the motions... It makes you depressed)

• limit news to about 1 hour a day, and 2 hours one day a week, maybe Sunday. (It will consume you, if you let it, trust me.)

• garden about 3 hours a week if you can. (Indoor pots let anyone have a green thumb)

• Eat a elaborate prepared, but well portioned and healthy dinner... ESPECIALLY if you live alone, fights ""lonely, don't care, eating whatever"". Make making food art.

• after dinner clean, every dish, every thing you made dirty. (Wednesday I clean whole place, takes about 3 hours)

• after dinner go for a walk, half hour to a hour.

• if you work from home work another hour or two after walk, if not read a novel.

• learn to makes or tinker on something useful not just puzzles; knit, sew, wood carve, tinker on broken machines.

• read a chapter a day; fiction or nonfiction, doesn't matter.

• set a time of day you call or text a friend.

• have a market day

• have hiking/gardening/outdoors day if you can

• have a strict bed-time.

My toddlers behaviour has been terrible at times but I stead for being furious with her I have to remember her little world has been turned upside down. No seeing friends, no play groups, no park, no nursery school, no days with her nanna which she loves and no seeing her cousins.

3335,"Best friend wants to have her bachelorette party at Disney. As the MOH, I’m conflicted. Hey everyone. 

I’ve known my best friend, Emma, since we were kids. She’s currently set to get married in January and is a huge Disney fan and is wanting to have her bachelorette party at Disney. Keep in mind, we don’t live in Florida so we’d be flying down, staying at her family’s time share, and doing whatever activities she wants. 

As her maid of honor, I’ve felt that I’ve had to say yes to flying to Florida, going to Disney, and whatever else she wants to do because she’s the bride and my best friend. However, as the date of departure gets closer and closer (its one month away), I’m really finding myself concerned about the safety of the trip and I’m doubting whether I want to go or not. 

I have no idea if the bridal party is going to be tested prior to leaving, so who knows if her friends have it. She’s also adamant about going to Disney (I talked her down from two days to spending one day in the park so her brother can propose) and is now wanting to go to some Pirate Adventure dinner theatre — so two VERY populated places. She’s been very amodating to how I’m feeling regarding COVID, but I don’t think she’d be pleased if I just outright canceled on this trip. I’d be more than happy to throw a *small* party at home to make up for it. 

I guess I’m just conflicted on how safe it is to travel, go to Disney, and hang out with a bunch of untested people for a week.

I feel like I spam this subreddit with how often I have toe here. I am COVID positive, but so far almostpletely asymptomatic except for some dizziness and sleepiness for about 3 days. Now that I have had it and it's getting out of my system i should feel great right? I should feel like the worst of it is over right? sadly that isn't the case. I already have healthy anxiety, but can usually keep it at bay. However, I am just absolutely terrified of the uncertainty with COVID effects on long term health. Usually I can see what the incidences are on long term disability and stuff and feel good that the numbers are pretty low for most conditions. But with COVID I cant do that. I cant just google how many people are disabled or have a much lower quality of life from it. As a result, I am FUCKING TERRIFIED, and really don't know how to deal with this anxiety that's eating me up. 

Worse even, I just read the recent report that says 80 percent get really bad heart damage. 

I am a type A personality, so whenever I do all the work and stuff I usually do to keep myself busy I really cant anymore because I ask myself ""why am i doing all of this if im gonna drop dead one day?"" or ""What's the pint of this if you'll be disabled for the rest of your life?"" 

I haven't had anxiety flare up this bad ever in my short 20 years of life. I am deeeply passionate about fitness and keeping myself healthy so the fact that I am just so helpless with this just makes me want to cry. 

&#x200B;

If any of you guys have any tips on how to deal with this please thank you so much.",3,0.67,i1kvc5,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i1kvc5/how_to_deal_with_crippling_anxiety_about/,4,Support,2020-08-01,-13,84,-0.15476190476190477
3343,"Scared about going back to my 'job' Hey all.

I'm a tattoo apprentice in the UK. I live with my Mum + Stepdad 45 mins outside of the city centre on public transport (don't drive), the tattoo shop is another 20 mins (bus + train). Just before COVID kicked off, I was getting really in to practicing and was starting to improve, but naturally all the tattoo shops closed (which I was very happy toply with). Our shop has now reopened, but I said to the owner I won't being back until August.

...August is now very rapidly approaching and I am really, really scared to go back. I have quite an intense anxiety disorder and the thought of sharing a space with other people + increase my exposure to others is making me so scared. I've got people messaging me about appointments etc and I just don't know what to say to them or the owner- I don't know what to do. We've been given PPE (visor and aprons) but I can't shake the feeling of dread. I can't feel okay about it.

I've been thinking maybe I should just try find remote work + tell the owner I won't be back until COVID is over or we wait and see what the winter brings in terms of a second spike...but I feel so guilty. My girlfriend told me she'd be really disappointed if I quit tattooing now, and that I need to try and get used to this new way of normal.

My mental health has taken a severe down turn in the last few months, and I have taken steps to go back in to therapy and counselling (first appointment in August). My Grandma passed from COVID in May, which was hard. I'm just terrified about getting it and spreading it to my loved ones.

Sorry this post is all over the place and poorly written. I'm just in a bad place, with little job prospects.  I understand the immense privilege of not being forced in to work through apany etc & recognise my circumstances are not nearly as dire as many.  I can't tell if I am being rightly worried or paranoid.

If anyone has any advice or support for the situation I would appreciate it.",3,0.71,hx895d,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/hx895d/scared_about_going_back_to_my_job/,7,Support,2020-07-25,-10,107,-0.09345794392523364

3345,"Freaking out after taking risks Okay so, to preface, I have OCD and anxiety. I live in the UK and for the first few months of lockdown I was totally isolated and did not leave my flat almost at all, other than for walks. I had everything delivered and I washed my hands constantly and wore masks. However, I live alone and due to bad mental health I recently managed to get back in contact with my estranged father, who offered for me to go and stay with him and his wife. Desperate for people around me and sick of being stuck with my thoughts, I went.

The change in lifestyle was so sudden and drastic that I honestly dropped my guardpletely for the first two days. My dad took me out to a shopping centre and we walked around busy shops for several hours. I wore a mask and he didn't. Then the following day his stepdaughter and her family came over indoors for hours on their way back from shopping, nobody distanced. And today I heard my dad and his wife cough a few times throughout the day and I was suddenly snapped back to reality. Holy shit. I'm terrified. 

I'm supposed to be seeing my boyfriend at the beginning of next week for the first time in a while and I'm so so scared I'll be asymptomatic pass it onto him, or that I'll have to cancel because I'm sick. I've really fucked up. I can't believe after months of being so careful I've ruined it. My dad and his wife dont take this seriously at all, they never wear masks and they even invited a builder in for a cup of tea. Because I hadnt spoken to him for so long it didn't occur to me that he might not act responsibility. I really don't know what to do. I feel so scared. I want to go back and be by myself again but now I know it'll be so much worse because I'll be convinced I have the virus and checking myself every second of the day.

3346,"Disappointed in how the government is handling Covid-19. In mid May, my estranged sister texted me scared and stated that she was feeling very sick as if she had a bad flu and was afraid that she had Covid-19. I advised her to get tested and to stay quarantined but she refused and stated that she had to work. I was both angry and scared that she would disregard not only her health but put others at risk too! 

I called the non emergency line of the police to ask for advice. They said that they don't deal with this and to call the health care department. I looked up the number of the department of health of my city and they were not connected. So, Icalled the coronavirus response team of my state and they notified me that they have no protocol to deal with this and transferred me to the department of health. This time the phone was ringing and someone picked up. I told her a quick summary of the situation and she told me to hold on because ""this sounds like it's going to be a good story"". Wtf?! After a brief moment she went back on and I told her everything. She said that there is nothing anyone can do and that if my sister was truly sick with Covid-19 she wouldn't be able to get up. I then asked her to clarify because there are asymptomatic people as well and why are we all taking precaution then? I then asked her if what she is saying is that my sister is allowed to go about and infect people. She didn't answer and ended the conversation. I was baffeled. I tried asking Reddit for advice but all of the subreddits that I tried removed anything that had to do with coronavirus. I felt desperate.

Since my sister works as a freelancer, I cannot call her work place so I texted her to at least stay away from my brother who has apromised immune system and warned him about her. That didn't stop her. She went over to his apartment and by early June, he was feeling very ill and got tested positive for Covid-19. By some miracle, he is doing better now. Could be because he got medical help asap. 

I just don't get it! Why have a coronavirus response team when they don't do anything?! Why have a health department?! Why is no one else trying to address this?!

3347,"My experience with what I believe to be Covid 19 It all started in early February when I developed that weird flu like illness and had shortness of breath, fever, and other cold and flu like symptoms..... 

Disclaimer: This is based purely off my experience and I'm not a doctor or medical professional. I used to be an EMT but my license has since expired. Didn't make enough money🤷🏼‍♂️

I live in Fort Lauderdale Florida which is in Broward County. One of the main counties affected by this virus in Florida. As I stated above I developed a weird illness in early February that about half my office devoloped and showed symptoms for. At the time I remember most people in the country and other parts of the world sounding and being sick. Playing call of duty online at night has you conversing with people in different states and even different countries. Many of which sounded sick at the point in time. I remember saying back then something weird is going on. Anyways I got over it like many did after about two weeks. 

About two months later we were having some construction done where I live and kicked up a lot of dust. Disturbing things that haven't been disturbed in years. During that time my throat became noticably irritated and I didn't feel well. I lost my sense of smell and taste which apparently means this virus may affect our central nervous system which would make sense because I had hypersensitivity to light and sounds for a little bit. I also woke up a few nights feeling out of breath and wide awake. Also remember having headaches and periods in time where I felt confused and very much out of it. My girlfriend also shared with my that she was experiencing some of the same symptoms. I attributed it to the dust because that just made sense and it was the only thing that had changed. Ended up staying at my girlfriends parents house with her for a few days. Symptoms pretty much persisted but I figured the dust or VOCs (volatile organicpounds) were still in my system. After about two weeks my noticable symptoms disappeared. We both agreed that we would rest and avoid unnecessary trips just to be on the safe side and do our best not to spread anything in case we had it. Shortly after the noticable symptoms disappeared but I woke up at 4am one night with one sided weakness in my body and a blood pressure of 182/110. It worked itself out after about a half hour. I later learned people were having strokes and heart attacks in the later stages of Covid recovery. Looking back I should have gone to the ER. About three weeks after that I feltpletely back to normal, exercising again and eating regularly. 


Now about two months after that experience began lands me to about 14 days prior to present day. The construction guys came and finished the project. Kicking up more dust and kicking up my symptoms again. Same symptoms appeared some being less noticable or severe and some being the same. Loss my sense of taste and smell briefly again, headaches came back and so did elevated blood pressure and brief moments of shortness of breath as well as hypersensitivity to lights and sounds. Feeling the fight or flight symptomsing often and strong especially at night when humans are naturally more anxious anyways. Now at this point in time I researched Covid quite a bit more and as time passed more theories and study's were being shared. This time I was tested for Covid and I'm still waiting on results. 

I have a couple theories of what may be happening. I've read about people testing positive a few times even after testing negative so maybe for some people the virus lays dormant for a short span while our body is still producing antibodies to fight it. I have also been reading some studies are showing antibodies are only being produced by the body for about two months which would also make sense for me. Now my theory is this, if this virus stays dormant while our body is still producing antibodies to fight it but not fully killing it what if when those antibodies start to wear off and maybe a stressful event for our immune system can kick start the Covid again? It would make sense for my situation. 

I know my circumstances are probably pretty unique but I wanted to throw this out there to spark some convo and thoughts.

3349,"Afraid of Going to a Psychiatric Hospital During a Pandemic I was screened and got approval to go to a residential treatment facility for mental health treatment. I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety for 15 years. I was barely functioning before. Every week, my therapist was basically telling me, “Don’t kill yourself between now and our next session. Call 911 if you don’t think you can stay safe.” The changes caused by the pandemic set me over the edge. Even though I had a job, I couldn't work. 

The local residential facilities are either not appropriate for my diagnosis (i.e. substance abuse or eating disorders only) or don’t accept my insurance.  My insurance doesn’t have any out of network benefits and paying out of pocket would cost more than I make in a year. I was referred to an in network facility that is in another state, about 2,000 miles away (I am currently living with family). 

I looked at their website and here are some of the precautions they say that they are taking for Covid-19:

* Required COVID-19 testing as part of admission criteria
* Obtained cleaning and protective health equipment
* Closed campus, limiting visitors
* Health screening on employees, clients, and all essential visitors 
* Introduced masking and educated on mask care with employees and clients
* Comprehensive approach to social distancing on and between campuses

I really need this treatment, but I am nervous about traveling so far away and the risks of participating in person. Fifty minutes of teletherapy with a brand new therapist is not cutting it. I have no social support.

I mentioned previously in my pro r/covid19 thread that I am disturbed at the pro-China posts on reddit and the doomer porn on r/coronavirus. I also mentioned about the increasing support for authoritarian measures in the name of stopping the virus.

This is a bit of a paradox since this is a threat to our public health and safety of the American people and we should definitely continue to follow the guidelines by your local health and state officials. 

Yet I am growing increasingly worried about how easily persuaded people are in giving up their civil liberties during a time of national emergency. I understand their side of why its necessary and reasonable but it doesn't mean its right. 

The Department of Justice, Barr apparently wants to suspend some constitutional protections such as Habeus Corpus during this crisis. If this goes on for months (doesn't mean that it's inevitable) we're looking at parts of our rights thrown out the window for a while.

I hope I am not causing more anxiety that's not what I want to do on here. There is light at the end of this tunnel. Over 100,000 people have recovered since this outbreak began and a lot more will recover from this virus. But let's also be realistic with the fallout that is occurring with covid19.

But keep strong everyone. A bit of an update from last week. Work officially closed on the orders of our governor of Wisconsin. They told us to file for unemployment but they stressed to me and to others that we are not being laid off. Thank god. We will resume operations at Goodwill when it is safe to do so.

TLDR: Virus worries me, and yes social distancing makes sense and we should take these measures. Still disturbing to see how many people are perfectly fine with losing civil liberties and due process and calling for bloody murder for those who DARE to go out for a jog. Still mainly good news in the sense that over 100,000 have recovered! Woo hoo! :3

Edit, I should also add that I understand why these measures are being put in place and fuck those beach goers, I am just giving my two cents.

3373,"I feel anxious about people who judge others for going outside and doing riskier activities. Repost because I hate the live discussion format, it's impossible to read on mobile. 

So first off I live in an area that was not hard hit at all by Covid. I have been doing my best to slow the spread for nearly three months now. Our government is slowly but surely lifting certain restrictions and I am eager to get back to a certain kind of normalcy.

I am normally not anxious about Covid itself, since I have been looking at raw data both from my province and from the rest of the world and I have personally determined that I am okay with the risk. I don't know anyone at risk and those I know who are at risk are taking necessary precautions.

In light of restrictions being lifted and small gatherings being allowed, my MIL invited my boyfriend and I over for a BBQ. It's been extremely hot here (like 32 ° C hot or around 88 ° F if I'm not mistaken) and it's especially hard to stay inside because of that. I have mentioned that I will go to her place (outside) for the BBQ and people on Facebook and Reddit have constantly posted things shaming other people for doing this or going to the beach or simply going outside. It makes me super anxious that they would say something like ""you'll be sorry once you'll catch it"" or ""why would you want your parents to die"" or something. This is probably their intention but I feel guilty about wanting to hang out with my family and friends now, even though I'm allowed, just like I felt guilty about going to the park earlier.

How do I detach myself from this and just ignore what these people say, while still taking precautions? I'm tired of being anxious every time I go out because I can only hear people judging me for doing so in the back of my mind.",16,0.75,gs73c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gs73c8/i_feel_anxious_about_people_who_judge_others_for/,30,Support,2020-05-29,-16,90,-0.17777777777777778

3381,"What to tell loved ones about not visiting to keep each other safe? My small circle of loved ones includes both family and my partner/friends. All of us have been taking extra care this year with Covid-19. All the precautions and extra precautions to boot. I'm happy to say that the people I know are good about taking care of themselves but at the same time I feel like it isn't to the same standard as I have been. And that's not like, a pat on the backment. I live about an hour from both parties, so any social thing usually consists of me crashing for a weekend at either house. Social distancing visits aren't as worth it with gas, mileage and money purposes.

Lately both parties have been really trying to pull me into visiting. They themselves have begun having their close friends/family over who they are also confident are keeping safe in these times. But that also feels risky? My living situation is very paycheck to paycheck, so I can't risk getting myself or my roommate sick and that's likewise to my partner and our friends. As well, health risks for my family who are older.

It's a frustrating grey zone where it feels like my small circle is aware enough to be careful but then hits a dead end and kind of makes me feel like I'm in the wrong for being so cautious? I haven't seen the majority of them for most of the year, and it sucks but Covid-19 is also really dangerous so if feels justified?

I try and be upfront with them on my feelings and why I'm refusing them but it feels like my reasoning is losing impact. I just don't know if there is another angle I could be taking. I want to see them but I also want all of us to be as safe as we can be.

Things I like:

1) our building has a large amount of space. It is easy to avoid people. 

2) If people get too close we are allowed to move to another area and work there. 

3) we are allowed to take breaks from our masks outside. Although, I have yet to do that. I did in the beginning though. I usually just wait for my 15 minute break which I take outside in my car. 

Things I don’t like:

1) customers move their masks off their face when they think someone isn’t watching them. Some of the managers correct them and some of the managers don’t because they are afraid of backlash. 

2) if I am in an area working, a customer will walk up right next to me to look at something without warning. They should at least say, “excuse me, I need in there. Can you move a minute?” I would never get that close to someone. I would wait my turn until they move.

>Swim lessons and swim practice may be conducted only if the available space and skill of the swimmers allow for proper distancing between instructors and participants.

>What you should know:  
>  
>\- Instructors will be wearing face masks, we contacted thepany that we buy our swim suits from and had custom in water masks designed from our suit material

The face masks get soaked and aren't that great, maybemunicate face shields would be better

>\- Class sizes will be small to enable social distancing within the class area  
>  
>\- There will be no equipment used in lessons to reduce opportunities for exposure  
>  
>\- All persons entering the building over the age of 2 will be required to wear a face mask unless they are in the pool, per updated CDC guidelines  
>  
>\- Everyone entering the building must wash hands at our outside hand washing station prior to entry  
>  
>\- All persons entering the building, both swimmers and non-swimmers must have a signed COVID 19 waiver on file, this can be done the first visit (there is a link to the COVID waivers below if you would like to review it prior to your visit)  
>  
>\- We will strictly enforce wearing facemasks and social distancing in the building. We encourage caregivers to limit the number of observers and if possible wait outside, there will be a canopy set up on hot days and some families have been using the tree near the parking lot entrance for shade. We have marked the floor to indicate furniture positioning to encourage social distancing.

>\- There is a one way flow through the building, everyone enters through the main door after washing hands and checks in with desk staff. When exiting the facility, exit through the door on the far side of the pool area. There are mats leading back around to the parking lot.

>All policies are subject to change as we implement and follow best practices outlined by CDC and Maryland state health department.

Here is where I currently stand. Our counties public schools are going online for the fall (Maryland), meaning it is not safe to go back to school. If it is not safe for a teacher to teach from 6 feet away with a mask on both parties, how is it safe for me to teach a kid arms length away and be in contacts with swimmers when only i'm wearing a mask. Much of the information on this subject seems to be targeted towards parents and if their kids will be safe. I'm concerned about contracting COVID from a child that I teach.

Well, everything's falling apart in the final two weeks before her due date. On Monday I found out that someone has beening to my office covering up his Covid symptoms while awaiting test results. He called the manager on Thursday night to tell him that he'd lost his taste, but the manager asked him if he could still taste hot sauce (I'm not making this up) and when he could he said that he should get tested but should stille into the office. He was there for two days wearing a mask but didn't disclose that he was symptomatic and had been tested until he got his positive results. I quarantined myself at home and got tested yesterday. Today, the office has been closed indefinitely and everyone is required to get tested. I don't really have any symptoms, although of course now I'm hyper-aware of every little thing that I'm feeling. I don't have any real contact with the infected person from the office and am more concerned about other people who do and who have underlying conditions. Still, I can go through any amount of anxiety for the sake of my wife and unborn child. But last night, before going to bed in my quarantined zone of the house, my wife came to my crying that she'd been feeling cold-like symptoms (a runny nose, sneezing, etc.) all day. She didn't want to tell me because she was in denial about it herself.

Naturally, I'm trying to reassure her that cold symptoms aren't the same as Covid symptoms and that she doesn't have themon Covid cluster of symptoms (no fever, no cough, no shortness of breath), but inside I'm panicking and so is she. We spent all morning on the phone with her OBGYN and general practitioner, but all they said in short was ""go get a test if you want."" The wait time for results where we live is 10-14 business days, which makes getting tested practically pointless. There's really nothing that they can do, despite the urgency of the situation. The only way that she'd be able to get one of the blood tests that gives you results right away is if she's literally in labor. To top it all off, her OBGYN said that if she's still having cold-like symptoms by her weekly appointment, they won't see her.

Our world has been turned upside-down in just two days. Neither of us know what to do. We feel utterly helpless. What makes it even worse is that no one else seems to know what to do, either. For most of 2020, it's been one disaster after another - health disasters, economic disasters, political disasters, and now a natural disaster named ""Isaias."" Between the rising rate of new cases, the economic recession, the rushed reopening, the anarchic rioting, the authoritarian repression of the rioting, and more, I've be really afraid for the future of my country, and of course my family's place in it. The pandemic has exposed how weak and ""fake"" we are as a country - how little actually binds us together and how quickly we turn on each other when things turn against us. I've been dealing with all of these fears as stoically as I can, so as not to stress out my wife needlessly during her pregnancy, but now that it's hitting us in our home I don't know how to handle this.

3431,"I got takeaway food and now I'm afraid. So, I got some takeaway food tonight. I went home and ate it, and heated some of it up in the microwave, but reading the news and reflecting has sent me off into a bad headspace again.

I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle with people, and I have to justify my every precaution to most people around me (not all, but a lot more than I'mfortable with). I'm trying to show humility because I'm certain I'm not perfect, but it's fucking scary.

The place I went to? They said I shoulde in to pick up my food. I got there at the right time, and saw on the door a sign that said 'no mask, no business.' Great. I wore a mask and gloves, and they still took a few minutes, because they had a lot of orders. The place had a line of people waiting for pick-up, but not a lot of 'space' in between people, defs not 6 feet. I will say that every single person in the line was wearing a mask, though. I did my best to stand apart from the people in line, and then I turned around and saw that behind a little half-sized wall was a dining area. Indoors. With PEOPLE EATING. Like, definitely not 6 feet from the line. It was only 'half full,' I guess, but I also saw a girl at the till remove her mask before bringing food to people. And the guy handling orders, plus the chef? No masks. No gloves. I was so fucking hungry that I got home and like I said, did eat, but reflecting back on that I feel regretful and scared.

I don't think I'll be going out to eat again at any point soon. Everything is fucking terrifying. Why aren't people terrified? I'm so mad that this place doesn't have an e-mail or anything either. They're on Uber Eats and I don't know if I could leave a review or something. I'm honestly still kinda WTF about the whole thing. I'm planning on getting tested in a couple days.

Everything about my situation is wild and weird and nowhere is really 'mine.' I never feel safe. I don't know if I'll ever feel safe again.  


Update: I feel ill today. It could be from an unexpected sunburn I got a couple days ago. I don't seem to be running a fever, but of course I'm terrified now. If I still don't feel well later today/tomorrow I'll be going to get a test. Fuck these people. Fuck any restaurant that's reopening in the USA right now. It's too horrifying. I'm scared for my life and my family's life. This whole experience would have beenpletely fine if people weren't dining in. How can I hold anyone accountable? I did my best and I still might be fucked. I could die before ever seeing my boyfriend or my home again (been stranded overseas for 3 months). My family could die.

2. Such a strategy would require 100% accuracy. To mess up is to risk somebody's life. I don't know about your circulation department, but we make loads of mistakes when there isn't any life of death pressure.

3439,"I'm a critical worker, family asking me to note home. Looking for objective advice/opinions! Hello all. I am in serious need of advice. I will make every effort to stick to facts to put as little bias into this as possible as I am having a very difficult time remaining objective and separating my feelings from the situation I find myself in.

I work in support of the food and pharmaceutical industry maintaining and certifying equipment that is used to ensure items being produced are free of contaminants. Issues with the equipment I work on can stop production lines entirely which now more than ever is problematic.

My work requires extensive travel across state lines, staying in hotels etc. I have been working away from home for the past two and a half weeks. I have lived with my fiance and her daughter for the past 2 years. Prior to my leaving we discussed precautions I would take. The plan was for me toe home unless I had cause to believe I might have been exposed.

About a week ago, my fiance expressed concerns about the places I was travelling to and the risk of exposure. She asked me to note home unless I could self isolate for two weeks. This is for all intents and purposes impossible with my job schedule. I simply will not have a window of time where I can make that happen.

They both have health issues. Endometriosis being the primary and both tend to get sick more easily than most.

In respect of this I have taken every precaution I can think of. I have only traveled by car. I disinfect all surfaces in the hotels I stay at before even unpacking. I have not eaten out, only going to grocery stores in more rural areas, during off peak hours to buy items I can prepare in the hotel rooms. I wear a mask in public, use disposable gloves to pump gas. Only gas up my vehicle outside of metro areas. 

The nature of my work requires screening prior to entering facilities. All of the facilities require that I wear full PPE. Mask, gloves disposable outerwear etc. and social distancing is strictly enforced. At jobs I had interactions with about 12 people total. Other than gas and a weekly trip for groceries, I only go hotels and job sites.

Travel was in Twin Falls, ID, WA including Seattle, Yakima, Chehalis, Ontario, OR and Salt Lake City, UT. I live in rural CO.

They both work from home. They do not have health insurance. They run online businesses that have only recently started to perform well.

They are terrified of bing infected. Both for long term implications from potential medical costs and for how it could impact their recent success in business.

For my part, I feel as if I am being forced into limbo. Can't go home without causing serious upset. The isolation of spending potentially months in hotels. The extra expense for hotels for any stay not related to a job. Feeling like I no longer have a home. Feeling unwanted...

I feel incredibly torn. I respect and love them. I am having a hard time disentangling my feelings from this and being objective. I feel that with the precautions I am taking that the risk of them contracting the virus is very low. Am I looking at this the wrong way? Is any increased risk no matter how small unacceptable? Is what they are asking excessive? We've been unable to reach an understanding on the subject. Is it selfish of me to want to be able to go home? My emotions over this are a mess.

3440,"I went to the ER Friday I was so stressed over thinking getting the virus and dying. I ended up having chest pain that wouldnt go away nor could I getfortable so I reluctantly went to the ER.

They wanted to transfer me to another hospital for a stress test to rule out anything serious. I had to go by ambulance and the whole time I was worried about the EMS workers possibly being asymptomatic and me possibly catching it just by breathing the same air since he clearly wasn't 6ft from me even though he had a mask on. Whenever he asked how I was I'd cringe into the cover. Granted I had 2 masks on at the point. They told me they test them for their temperature but what if they have it and don't know and infect me? I kind of regret going, but what if i was having a heart attack?

. They did test me for covid which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but what's the point now if I was exposed while there AFTER I got tested? The hospital staff said they are doing the best they can to not allow people who are assumed to have the virus into the ER room where I was, but you you never know? Everyone is required to wear masks. I wore mine even when I was sleeping. I'm just trying to take their word for it.

Anyway after testing all day they concluded I don't have any noticeable heart problems which is good to know because if i did contract covid some people with heart problems can potentially have it affect their heart. The doctor said I seemed to be in good health and many nurses I asked said they've had quite a few successful covid patients so to try to think always think it's a death sentence plus their staff is ready to do the best they can to treat anyone with it.

I also learned my cousin who is hospitalized with the virus in the same hospital who they wanted to put on a ventilator which she refused is ready to leave the ICU although she still has to stay for monitoring. So I was so happy to hear that.

On Easter, my brother visited my at-risk parents and since then I have been subconsciously analyzing them for symptoms whenever I talk to them. 

I of course decided that my parents were infected, and that I needed to get them supplies to monitor symptoms - I have a pulse Oximeter and thermometer, neither of which they have. I put on a mask and gloves, cleaned both with a soft scrub bleach cleanser, and placed them in a paper sandwich bag to bring over.

She took the package in the house before I knew without using gloves (although she said she washed her hands afterward). But I was so scared I told her to leave the package where it was and not touch it for a couple days. It’s been on a chair in their living room because they live in a small apartment.

A strange accumulation of both

Mother Earth has provided the body, the frame for us to build upon

Man has taken liberties to perserve and expand the beauty we have been given

And though Mother is no longer the original model,

 we have created something amazing

From high up, this creature has aspects of both

Webine Mother and Child

From up above roads are veins in the Her skin,

 slicing through the transparent covering

Freckled with trees, scarred with barren wastelands

We change Her skin like we change ours- paintings, piercings, cosmetics

And while some consider this sacrilege,
I consider it natural

The nature of humans is change: 

It makes sense we would change Her,
She changes Us.

Our relationship isplex, a tangled web that is hard to decipher and would be even harder to dissolve.

People say if Man were to disappear, Earth would take back all we had changed.

But when we lose someone, do we forget? 
Truly forget?

Can we erase our scars and marks that make us who we have been and where we have been?

I dont think she would be able to. 

Sure, she would evolve and change with the circumstances, but she won't forget.

Our marks will not fade from her skin.

And then the body aches and cough kicked in, along with the strange dreams, burning eyes, chills and chest tightness. It's not severe (yet), but I feel like I have a bad flu, but...different. I did a video televist with my GP who i've known for the last fifteen years and he thinks I have it. And he set up a test on Tuesday. He is also my dad's GP and mentioned that even though my dad should be in horrible health due to years of not taking care of himself, smoking and working on vehicles as a career, he's always had a ridiculously strong immune system.  


And I think I may have gotten it from him, and that he's an asymptomatic carrier, as he is an essential worker, he still leaves the house daily. I'm 27 but currently living with my parents again after a fallout with a roommate before all of this started. My mom is sick too, but not nearly as badly as I am. I've taken every possible precaution, but I still most likely somehow have it. The only places I could have gotten it are from my dad or when I had an emergency and had to take my cat to the vet, but I wore a mask and gloves, never touched my face, etc. And that was less than a week ago.

I'm 27, i'm a (trying to quit) smoker, and I have anxiety derived heart palpitations frequently. 

Two of my friends had it but are on the mend, but I haven't had any physical contact with them since before this started. One of their fathers is clinging to life on a ventilator, though. The first death in my town was also someone I went to highschool with, same age, noorbidities.  I'm horrified this will take a rapid turn for the worse out of nowhere. I've also never had pneumonia so I don't know what it feels like. Right now I feel like I have bronchitis.  


I'm also scared that if I am positive for it, I will have one of those cases that drags on for months, if it doesn't kill me. Those seem to be increasinglymon.  


I'm horrified i'm going to die, or pass it on to someone else (i've been isolating in my room since this started), or having a case where I still have issues months down the line.  


I don't really know what to say, I just had to get it off my chest.

3450,"My 7 month pregnant girlfriend has suddenly got bad cold symptoms. What should I do? We have both been in the house since March 16. We have once a day half hour walks and we never get close to anyone. We go grocery shopping twice a week and they've got a good system in place where we're always 2m away from anyone. Only one of us goes in, we wash hands before and after, and also after we put the shopping away.

Our area (South West England) is one of the lowest hit areas in the country. Not many cases around here.

So, our chances seem low.

We've had no symptoms apart from mild hay-fever things like runny noses and sneezes when we're on our walks through the park and both of us have these symptoms every year anyway.

However, today, my girlfriend has woken up and she's very sneezy, sniffly, body aches, really tired (it's 11.15am and she's still in bed). She needed a paracetemol earlier and she says she has chills. She's freezing cold and I think it's quite warm in the house. She feels generally coldy and under the weather. She doesn't recognise this as normal hay-fever.

I know the advice is to drink lots, take medicine, hot showers etc whether it's just a cold or the virus.

But with her being 7 months pregnant, should I be doing anything else? Should we phone our GP just so he knows what's going on? Should she let her midwife know? She'd feel silly if it was just a cold but I don't know how we'd know for sure.

3456,"Some support needed to calm my anxious mind Hi guys

Thanks for all being here in this difficult time. I know everyone just wants to be told ""you're going to be ok"" and I know that's impossible to say. We're all doing whatever we can to avoid catching it.

My own personal story is (based in UK):

- I last went into work on Tuesday March 17 and only for an hour between 9-10am. Since then, I've been at home.

- My wife was in London with family and travelled back to our house in Bristol on March 24, as she was afraid she'd get stuck there with the lockdown. She has no symptoms and neither do her family. She's the only person I've been anywhere near since the 17th.

- We only leave the house for a 30 min walk in a deserted park once a day. We've been to a supermarket once a week, and we wash our hands before going in, and after we leave.


The number of cases in our area is 66 out of a population of 300,000. Number of deaths is 1. 
That's confirmed cases so there could be a lot more out there.


Looking at our actions and the numbers, I should be feeling safe. I can't think how I'd catch it. I think I'm doing the right things. I can't do anymore.


But I'm pretty anxious every day. I wake up with a sore throat or runny nose and assume that's the start. I have a heavy chest and assume that's the start. I feel a bit dizzy or get a bit hot out of nowhere and think the worst.

I assume if I get it, I'll die alone. I assume there won't be enough ventilators for me.

I see the 13 year old and 19 year old with no underlying conditions die and can think of no reason why that wouldn't be me as well.

My wife is 7 months pregnant and I want to be around to see the baby and to raise it. We've also got a 6 year old daughter. I can't die now, it's very bad timing!


How do other people on here manage anxiety? How do you quieten that voice that says ""it happened to them, why not you?"". And do you take any reassurance at all in numbers or probability?

3459,"I think I had a mild case of the vrius I'll start off by saying that I am 29 years old, work at a bank and am considered ""essential"" and have to report to work. Luckily ourpany switched to a drivethru only model a week or so ago. I've been extra cautious, wearing rubber gloves since then and even wiping down my station andputer with lysol wipes. 

At the end of last week I began to notice a feeling of being extra tired at work and at home. When Friday rolled around and I came home from work, I found myself passed out, face down in bed by 9 pm, early for me. 

Saturday I worked from 9-12pm and felt normal, but after work I couldn't shake this feeling that something was off. My partner made chili for dinner and I noticed I couldn't really smell it that well. Another night of passing out early while watching tv, but I woke up at 3 am Sunday freezing cold in a puddle of sweat and with this weird feeling of needing to breath deeply. I decided to take my temperature; 98.6. Odd for me, someone that always has a low body temperature around 97.5. Not wanting to disturb my partner, I decided to sleep on the sofa. 

Sunday morning, I slept in past my usual time of getting up to make coffee. When I finally woke up I had a tightness in my throat and that same weight in my chest. I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy my day off. I cleaned out my car and my partner and I decided to just drive around town for the heck of it, as nothing was open anyway. On the way back home my partner stoped at a Burger King, and the smell of the food made me feel sick. I also can't fight the urge to fall asleep right in the car. 

As the day progressed I could no longer ignore the tightness in my throat. I decide to have a look in the mirror and I immediately noticed my tonsils are huge and swollen, as are the lymph nodes in my neck. I take my temperature, 98.9. Anxiety sets in. Google tells me that swollen lymph nodes are a sign of viral or bacterial infection.

I lay low for the rest of the evening wondering how this is possibly happening. I take my temperature throughout the evening. 99.1, 99.2, and then around dinner time, 99.6. I go intoplete panic mode, calling my parents and my boss to tell them I might have it. I call a hospital and after asking a few questions, they tell me that I don't meet the requirements to be tested. Great, now what? I decide to take some acetaminophen and lay down. I can't sleep that night, I kept having the worst thoughts and I was up all night. But the good news was that my temperature was dropping. 

Now, cut to today, Monday. I woke up this morning at my usual time; craving coffee. I hop out of bed and immediately take my temperature; 96.9! Also, upon checking my tonsils, they seem to have reduced in size. I made it through today feelingpletely fine with none of the symptoms that I had just developed a few days before. 

I should also note that my partner has been working from home for two weeks and has shown no signs of anything and he's a smoker.

So does this sound like Covid 19??? If so, I can only think that my tonsils that I never had removed might have saved me from a worse case. As I type this I still do feel a slight weight in my chest, but not like the days before.

3461,"My test came back negative - I question its accuracy I developed symptoms roughly two weeks ago - first a sore throat, then a cough and temperature (around 100 but only for a few hours on two different days), runny nose and GI issues. The whole thing lasted for almost two weeks, I got a temperature of 100 again yesterday, but also a cold sore, so maybe that's where that came from.

Anyway, the reason I'm questioning the accuracy of the test is that the paramedic that came to test me did the following:

swabbed my one nostril for 2 or three seconds, no twisting or anything as far as I could see, didn't feel it at all besides some tickling - I'm not sure he even reached the back of my throat. Then did a cheek swab like they do with DNA sampled. He then placed the swabs on my dresser before putting it in the thingy. Also, they came after I had had symptoms for 12 days already, would there still be enough viral trace in my body to catch it? (especially the way they did it)

Does anyone know if this could somehowpromise the test result? Or was what he did alright?

The reason this makes my anxiety go up a bit is that I was kinda hoping I already went through it with extremely mild symptoms. I'm scared I'll get it now with a much more severe oue (I don't really fear that I'll die, I'm young and relatively healthy, but I don't want pneumonia or anything).

3477,"Would it be constructive to spread awareness of the actual reasons some people struggle with masks and how to deal with them? Or just foster more anti-mask panic? Masks have be a totally polarised issue, particularly in the United States. I think a large amount of it is caused by the government's response to the crisis, and in general perhaps a culture that encourages selfishness.

However I'm wondering if part of the reason why some people are anti-mask is because they have legitimate concerns that they don't see being addressed or acknowledged by people who are pro-mask. My experience has been that people who are pro-mask tend to make fun of people who have seemingly over-the-top reactions to wearing masks and say that they can't breathe in a mask. I think it's fair to mock people who are actually faking it but it can be hard to tell who's faking it and who isn't. I can see why making fun of someone claiming that they are struggling to breathe mighte across as cruel to people who are on the fence about the issue.

So my understanding is that masks/face coverings, as long as they're made of a breathable material, do not actually reduce the oxygen saturation of the air you're breathing. For the vast majority of people they are totally safe and no worse than mild difort.

However there are some reasons why people might genuinely feel short of breath or have other issues in a mask. I might have missed some but to my knowledge these are the main issues:

* Anxiety and sensory sensitivity. There are a lot of reasons why wearing a mask might induce anxiety. The mask panic has been scaremongering and causing people to feel afraid of masks. It's a sensitive part of the body and the sensation might make people feel ufortable or anxious (especially if they already have sensory sensitivity, which ismonly associated with autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, but you don't need to be diagnosed with any of those things to experience sensory sensitivity). It can also feel kind of claustrophobic to some people. The anxiety in turn makes them feel short of breath, and without awareness of their anxiety or the ability to cope with it, they might attribute their shortness of breath to the mask instead of anxiety.

* Humidity. Naturally since the whole point of wearing a mask is to stop the vapour from your breath spreading, the mask traps some of the hot vapour. Humidity can be a trigger for issues such as asthma and allergies. It can also affect your skin, so it can also cause other issues like acne outbreaks. At an extreme concentration, humidity it can make it harder to breathe even for people without those conditions. Trying to reduce the overall level of humidity in the environment (e.g. getting a dehumidifier for the office) and wearing face coverings made from different, more breathable materials can sometimes help reduce the level of humidity.

* Allergens being trapped in filters and filters getting blocked. Masks with filters need to be changed really frequently but not everyone who wears a mask with a filter is aware of this. If the filters aren't changed often enough, then pollen, dust, and other particles build up and it can be harder to breathe, exacerbate allergies, and make the mask less effective. So just wearing a mask without a filter, or changing the filter more often, could help a great deal.

* Very young children. [More info about why](

Personally I am an autistic asthmatic with allergies and I am totally fine andfortable wearing a face covering for long periods, even exercising, but that doesn't mean every autistic, allergic, or asthmatic person can. My stance is that the vast majority of people can and should wear masks when with people outside their household, as well as taking other precautions. Most anti-maskers have some kind of political or personal motive that isn't related to any genuine health concern. However when people are claiming to be having trouble breathing in a mask, even if it seems faked, I'm wary that if they are dismissed as an irrelevant minority that isn't worth talking about, or automatically assumed to be disingenuous/faking it without proof, it might be unintentionally alienating people who are genuine in their concerns.

I have seen a lot of remarks such as ""If you can't wear a mask, you should be shielding and you shouldn't be outside"" but that is not really true. People with mild asthma who are otherwise healthy don't need to be shielding but they might have an asthma attack triggered by humidity. People with sensory issues but healthy immune systems don't need to be shielding. And even if they should be shielding, many people who would prefer to shield if possible are not exempt from work and have to do their own shopping etc. 

Instead of just dismissing it I think it would be better to troubleshoot it and see if there might be a reason why they are struggling with a mask, and figure out if there may be a solution that would allow them to wear a mask, at least for short periods.

However I am concerned that trying to spread more awareness of these issues might be taken the wrong way and just used to fuel more anti-mask panic.

Naturally I am socially isolated at the moment so please tell me if I'm wrong and this is actually something people are aware of and are talking about a lot. But in my experience this is actually not something I have really seen people talk about a lot and I am wondering if it would be good to start a broader dialogue and maybe spread more awareness about it.",8,0.75,igbn01,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/igbn01/would_it_be_constructive_to_spread_awareness_of/,13,Discussion,2020-08-26,-32,322,-0.09937888198757763

3479,"I don't havemunity where I live and Reddit is getting more and more toxic, and I'm losing my shit I tried to reach out on r/changemyview about struggling with teaching online and was banned for mentioning the current situation. Many subs are making blanket bans about covid and reducing the onlinemunity that I had, such as it was. People are getting really mean and downvoting everything I say. 

I don't have anyone except my husband to rely on where we live, and we are in China as foreigners working legally, but our families are thousands of miles away. 

Ourpany has stopped giving updates as of two weeks ago and I'm just sure they will close this month. We will lose our visas and our house, and have to pay $4000+ to leave China and go to our ""home"" countries separately. We can't get visas for each other's countries because the whole of the US/UK immigration services are closed. 

We were supposed to stay here another year and finally be able to have a family. We've never recovered from the Great Recession and we only just had enough stability to even think of it, and I'm 32 and we don't have much time to conceive left. 

Every dream I've ever had has been taken by events out of my control and now this happens.

3484,"I guess me being fat means I'm a goner by the end of his pandemic Maybe this is more of an r/offmychest post, and I'm sorry if so, but it's COVID-related and I wanted to weed out those 'guess you're getting what you deserved, LOLZ' typements as much as possible. According to the news, my 5'6ish 273 pound self is pretty much a goner if I get COVID. Despite finally making the effort (starting right before COVID spread to America), using the stationary bike for 12 miles each day (4 times/week) and losing 23 pounds so far, along with having no major underlying conditions as per my doctor's visit a week ago, guess I started too late. My doctor did not seem worried about me when asking about my risk in COVIDplications, but considering my 129/89 blood pressure at that same visit, I keep having doubts and am preparing that if I catch COVID, this could be the end for me.

I'm doing all I can to avoid it (only going out for groceries or walks, and luckily having to work from home), but if I catch it, I'll likely be a statistic as a 27 year old guy. I get that fat is unhealthy (especially at my size), I get it increases chances ofplications for many diseases in general, but reddit and my news feed in general is getting filled with all these 'obesity=COVID death' type articles and discussions more and more, it's hard to shake out of my head and is effectively stamping out what's left of the 'We Can Do It' mindset that I had when we initially got into this mess. I accepted my fate, drafted my final statement in case I end up in ICU, but I'll still keep on my diet/exercise regime in the meantime in hopes for the best, even if my time feels limited now. Thanks for reading.

3492,"NEW YORK CITY to NEW YORK SHITTY ...but the lights still shine bright. Since many of us are home quarantining with milk and cookies while binge watching *Netflix*, I thought I’d open up a window into my world as a New Yorker during these COVID days. I find myself here on Reddit with a fire in my belly to share and internalize my experiences. **In the process I hope I can crack a smile on your face.**

If you didn’t know, New York City has a mostly aggressive and no nonsense approach to the everyday experience. We are ASSHOLES..(at least it looks like it) for good reasons. We want our food fast. We HATE looking for parking. We want to own apartments and choose to live on pennies to have a decent place. We want to spend less money. We want work to end quickly without having to endure a painful rush hour via public transportation. Or is that just me? Amid all the hectic obstacles that are sometimes unavoidable, **we want joy.** Joy in business, love, friendship, spirituality, family, freedom. I’ve found that it can get lost in distractions that the city presents. This is not the New York City I currently live in. **There’s a new asshole in town.** His name is COVID-19, and he is dictating our lives. Maybe not everyone’s. Since his arrival, paranoia and real change has been present. Life feels like a movie -a sort of sci-fi drama with twists and turns. For some, it’s a joke and another way to capitalize on being funny on an Instagram feed. Otherspletely disregard science or make ignorant statements like “tobacco kills people, but people are worried about COVID.” Here’s a shout-out to the bonehead for not pointing out that COVID-19 can take your life within days/weeks. I’m positive but realistic. Sorry people, I’m with science on this one. Don’t get me started on the almighty saving us. God may take care of us.. **in the ER**, and now I sound like an asshole.

4 weeks ago, I began to repair a relationship. We were easing back into a promising one, but the timing wasn't exactly convenient. COVID-19 was present in New York and New Jersey, but the spread wasn’t as significant as it is now. (I feel like Rick from *The Walking Dead* narrating the outbreak’s beginnings). She had concerns about a case in Westchester, Bronx, only a few miles away from where I live. She was heading to Miami, Florida for a personal vacation. I told her not to worry, and I agreed to take care of her 10 percent headache / 90 percent sweet and perfect couch potato of a puppy at my place. We enjoyed one last lunch date before her departure. It was memorable because of the genuine nature of enjoying our time together, but it was also a notable moment of fear and preparation for the unknown bing real. I vividly remember doing some grocery shopping with her and seeing hordes of masked customers stacking their carts with water, chicken, and tissue (the outbreak essentials!). Our day ended with a sweet kiss and a 30 min Uber ride to the Bronx with initial puppy cries back home.

A few days later, I received a notice on my door about someone possibly being infected in my building’s management office less than half a mile away. **SHIT.** Back to my boo..

While in Miami, she texted me every day with some sort of update on how her day was. On one particular night, she didn’t respond. I intuitively felt something was wrong and followed it up with a call. No answer. The next day, I found out she was in the emergency room. SHIT. (It was a knee and hernia issue that required surgery). The hospital eventually released her early due to the rising demand of patients with **REAL emergencies.** She flew back home on her own while being assisted on a wheelchair. **Talk about a SHIT end of a vacation.**

I spent a few more days with my step daughter pup while she was home recovering. This was a time of rapid thoughts, questions, and furry bonding. Dog walks were spent with surgical gloves and occasional masks. Workouts were taken outdoors, a perfect way to alsopliment dog playing time. I began to receive a lot of phone texts / COVID-19 updates about the urgency to stay home. The NEWS presented important to misleading information, and so I began to focus on getting FACTS from respectable scientists. When I wanted to take a BREAK from the news and escape in the world of sports, repeat playoff games reminded me of the impact of this virus. Businesses were preparing to shut down, and I hated not being able to sit down at my local coffee spot or bar that allowed dogs. “Where do I go from here? I’m not part of the demographic,” I told myself. “I’m fit!... or am I? I’m a type 1 diabetic. **Am I considered HIGH RISK?** Ugh. Should I go to work? Should I take public transportation to work?” My train rides aren’t packed, and my 6am Monday morningmute is now quiet and peaceful, but homeless people are swarming them as temporary shelters. FUCK. I guess this is all an illusion. As for the pup, I wondered if I should be concerned about her licking me like a damn ice cream? Could I infect her? When I see my boo again, should I not kiss her? When will we have sex again! Can I bend the rules for social distancing? UGH. **Everything is in slow motion these days.**

When I returned my step daughter pup, **SHE** asked if I’d be offended if she sprayed me down with Lysol disinfectant. I warmly laughed and told her I understood. In fact, I wasn’t sure if she wasfortable with me staying. I didn’t know if I should lay down next to her, especially since she was already recovering from her operation and experiencing pain from another condition due to a past pregnancy. If I had this virus, would I be endangering her? Her dad was also there, and I wondered how me possibly being infected could endanger him. She wanted me there, and I wanted to be there, but I would have easily left. I probably should have. It was all so confusing to try to make the best decision. The next few hours felt like earlier times as we Netflixed and quaran-chilled. I even baked her some surgical masked cupcakes with a box that read “Will you be my Quarentine?” (A play on Valentine). A few hours later she felt a pain in her stomach and needed to head to the emergency room. I JINXED IT. SHIT.

I haven’t been to an emergency room in years. I helped her inside, and even though my priority was to get her in quickly and tended to, I couldn’t help notice a containment area outside by the ER entrance. As we entered, the air felt thick, or maybe that was my paranoia talking. The nurses probably mistook me for a patient, and so that likely bought me extra time inside. **Five minutes inside that area was a lifetime of fear.** My boo trembled and cried, and then she reached her hand out to firmly grab mine. It was the first time I experienced this flush of emotion to want to protect her, where nothing mattered, The NBA didn’t matter. Netflix didn’t matter. Going to work didn’t matter. I saw an overweight man on a respirator being pushed on a stretcher right by me, and all I could think about was whether he had the infection. I’m sure she thought the same. EVERYTHING was in slow motion. She reached out her hand again, and I told her everything would be okay. The nurse then requested that I wait outside.  **“Everything is infected,”** she said. Those very words ping ponged around in my head as I proceeded to the exit in a trance-like state.

For the next few hours, I patiently waited for the oue at the ER. I sat on the one lone chair outside the entrance in protective gear messaging / receiving messages from my boo while drinking coffee to prepare for what would end up being a 5 hour process of broken sleep and seeing different walks of life drop in. I looked like Kenny from *South Park* with my eyes peeking through a hoodie tightly secured around my face. “I appreciate you bringing me,” she told me. **Those words alone made me feel a sense of value in her life**, and I was happy to be by her side. I wish I could have physically been inside, but I tried my best to send her some good “juju” / energy. I needed some myself while hearing intense radio chatter echo from within the hospital’s walls.The next few hours gave me time to internalize the reality of real fear, love, and what the future held. I thought about my newborn nephew and wondered when was the next time I was going to hold him. I wondered when I’d be able to be in the physical presence of my grandmother that I never built a strong relationship with. I thought about my brother who is asthmatic. When will I have a reunion with friends to kick the shit. My parents are relatively healthy, but are they truly safe? Despite these rational fears, I was happy to be in a space that made me seek important answers and find real purpose. My heart guided my actions. “I can afford to call out of work tonight,” I told myself. “I want to be here. \*\*This is genuine love..\*\*Love for my family.. Love for my boo.. Love for my friends and everyone that have had an impact in my life.”

I decided to go back to her place and pick her up after her results. As the night progressed, her mood was more upbeat, but her observations were telling of the world we live in, especially for nurses and doctors putting their lives on the line for us. With limited supplies available, they still provided her with extra treatment. They cautioned her against bringing shoes inside her apartment. They revealed alarming information about deaths from the night before and the high risk exposure from doctors and nurses themselves that lived in New York City. **Has she been exposed? Have I?** SHIT. SHIT. SHIT.

After a couple of hours at my boo’s place zoned in on CNN updates, she was released from the hospital. I immediately Uber’ed my way back to her. Her spirits were higher and she was mostly pain free. She was cleared of COVID-19 systems in the process. She expressed gratitude for my presence, and I reminded her that she was a priority. **She is a priority**.. but *where do we go from here?*

I don’t know when’s the next time ill be cuddling with my boo again or when we will have a worry free night and can dance the night away. I know relationships can beplicated, but COVID-19 threw me a curveball. **Physical touch is therapeutic**, and there lies the dilemma. I hate that I can’t touch her. Maybe I can, but I shouldn’t. I won't ask for it. Is COVID-19 affecting relationships for everyone else? Is it making it worse? Stronger? I believe this separation from the people I love made me realize what I’ve taken for granted or never properly expressed. **I’m not religious, but this feels like a test.** I hope I’m passing.

There’s still so much I don’t know, but these days I’m trying to be vigilant about my health and how I affect others. That’s not always easy. **Humans are bound to fuck up.** I’m trying my best to embrace the challenge and this new dynamic. The escalating death toll is real. The infected are real. The confusion is real. LOVE is real, and that doesn’t have to die with COVID-19.

3495,"Not everyone can wear a mask: Tips for those few who can't If you legitimately can't wear a mask, then you likely already know your condition and have had to make life adjustments pre-COVID already. COVID just adds another pile of problems to solve.

There's a lot of rhetoric that makes it hard to figure out what your options are if you're an edge-case. Some situations are harder than others, but here's some tricks I've worked out over the months that I've had success with.

&#x200B;

**# Not all masks are the same**

Different masks are made of different materials, which may make enough of a difference to allow for quick grab-and-go errands.

I've found that the disposable surgical-style masks cause the least problems for me. You're not really supposed to be using them, but that's mostly to encourage re-usable masks to avoid a supply shortage. Finding anything that lets you meet the mask requirements will help in a lot of situations.

&#x200B;

**# Show up REAL early, have a plan**

If you've found a mask that kinda works, but you can only wear it for so long before you have a problem, then show up early when the store opens. For me, that's 6am.

It sucks, but it means you can avoid people and lines that might risk you needing to drop everything and run out the door when your problem bes too much.

If you're going to be under time pressure, you also don't want to be wandering around looking for something. Call ahead if you don't know where it's located, someone can check the inventory count and tell you exactly which aisle has it. If you can't find it, ignore it and call back later asking for more clarification for next time.

&#x200B;

**# Order stuff online, ship to home**

This may be obvious, but you don't need to wear a mask at home, so have stuff sent to you. The logistics of this will vary depending on your home situation and what you need.

&#x200B;

**# Order stuff online, ship to store, pickup in parking lot**

You may not be able to get deliveries to your home. Yes, these situations exist, and they suck. You can still buy things from most modern brick-and-mortar stores, have them delivered to the store, and pick them up there.

This generally works by ordering online, specifying the store, being notified of the arrival, showing up and calling or using an app, then an employee wanders out and puts the stuff in your trunk or leaves it next to your car and wanders back in.

Some stores are app-only, and you might not have apatible phone. Or, you might not even have a cell-phone at all. In these cases, you might have luck showing up at really low-traffic hours, cautiously entering the store without a mask, and trying to flag down an employee. If you're polite and gracious, this usually works. It helps to call ahead though and let them know you've got a problem so you can work out how to best handle this and they know to expect you.

&#x200B;

**# Order stuff online, ship to mail locker**

Amazon lockers are a thing. You can get stuff mailed to them, show up, and just take it out of the locker. Note that not all lockers are outdoors and accessible without needing to go into a mask-only area, so you should make sure you know where the locker is and scout it out before you get something mailed there.

Theoretically, there are some places that have general mail lockers for things that you can't get on Amazon, but I'm not aware of any that are consistently available nation-wide. If you know of some, please share.

&#x200B;

**# Have someone buy your stuff for you**

If you can't get things delivered, and you don't have a car, then you can pay someone who does have one to take it somewhere that you can also get to. Some stores have this as an option in online ordering, and they contract it out to one of these 'gig economy'panies. You can also just contract them yourself.

Keep in mind that they're not going to be super enthused about you not wearing a mask, so let them know in advance and ask what would make themfortable. You just need your stuff, you can stand 30 feet away and have them leave it on the ground, it's a minor inconvenience at that point.

&#x200B;

**# Last resort**

All these things assume you have access to the internet in some fashion, since you're reading this. If you don't, and you have no local social support network, then you're going to need to be creative with your land-line phone. Someone somewhere is willing to help you for a price, and I think 4-1-1 is still a thing. Get creative.

And maybe this is just my hometown. But I’ve noticed in the last few days that a lot of people have gotten downright nasty and are worrying wayyy too much about what others are doing, even in areas like mine where there is no official “stay at home” order. For example, a lady today called the state police on a church that was having a service. (The police did tell her they weren’t going to do anything about it.) People are getting angry at others who are walking or running together and not maintaining distance. (According to them.) I walked by a couple today who clearly weren’t six feet apart, but you know what I did? I kept walking! I’m not going to waste my own limited energy and stress on calling the cops or berating people who aren’t standing exactly six feet apart.

3501,"Dealing with anger toward someone you live with who isn't taking precautions? Trigger warning for arguments between family members and anger?

How do you cope when you feel like someone is putting you at risk?  I've been fighting with my father near daily lately because I feel like he isn't doing simple things that would help protect us both.  Example: he keeps trying to go to the store for things that are not essential right now, like a replacement bulb for the stove.  Or when we had to go out the other day for food he refused to wear gloves 'because they make his hands sweaty'.  He then fought me on using hand sanitizer after we went to the bank 'because he didn't really touch anything.'  Then proceeded to go through the drive through, touch the bank canister, and then touch the steering wheel of my car.   

I know the risks of surface transmission like that is relatively minimal.  But it makes me so angry because wearing gloves and using sanitizer are such simple, small things.  We got into a huge fight and I told him that it would be one thing if he was only putting himself at risk, but he's risking my life too.  And even more importantly to me, he's putting our cats at risk...if we both get sick, who will take care of them?  He told me he feels like I'm punishing him for not doing what I want.  I told him I feel like he doesn't care about me all that much since sweaty hands are apparently more pressing then my health.  It was a pretty nasty argument.  

The weird part is that he's not generally dismissive of the dangers.  He watches the news and is angry at the way all of this has been handled.  Show him a video of someone licking produce or a mass gathering in a church and he gets enraged.  And then he wanders around buying useless light bulbs and touching things.  There's this massive disconnect between his actions and his emotional response that I don't know how to handle.  

And to top it off, he's an essential worker for the postal service. How can I trust that he's practicing social distancing or cleaning his hands at work?  He claims he is.  I'm bleaching the high touch items in the house multiple times a day.  AND he's a diabetic and 75!!  I keep trying to explain that I'm reacting with fear and anger because his risk is greater then mine and I don't want him to get sick.  

I don't want to keep fighting with him.  It's making us both miserable.  He DID agree to take more precautions because of our last big blow out, but really only so I won't keep nagging him.  I want him to take precautions because he understands the risks and wants to protect both of us.  I feel like otherwise I can't trust him to take them when I'm not right there. After we fight I'm usually able to go over the facts and risks and he asks intelligent questions and engages, but then the next day everything starts over again.

3515,"Safe to do a small getaway at an AirBnB? My spouse and I have been stuck at home for months. We both work from home and we only go out to get essentials such as curbside groceries. We take this pandemic pretty seriously.

This year is our 20th wedding anniversary an we had plans to travel for our anniversary but canceled everything flights, hotels, etc. 

My spouse is pretty bummed out about the whole situation as we finally saved up enough money over the years to go on a dream vacation on our 20th.

I would like to surprise my spouse by going on a short getaway to the coast. Staying at an AirBnB with enhanced cleaning. Only stopping for gas. Bathroom breaks are planned using forrest service roads by digging a cat hole (packin and pack out) or purchasing a portable toilet off amazon.

We would get groceries via curbside on the way to the coast. 

After checking in to the AirBnB, we would probably disinfect all surfaces again and open windows for fresh air circulation. It would only be myself and my SO. We plan on staying put once we get to the coast, maybe drive to some senic areas but would stay away from people. 

Does this seem like a crazy, unsafe plan? Has anyone recently stayed at an AirBnB or did a road trip and not gotten covid?

3516,"I hesitate to eat any prepared, refrigerated food I bought a frosted chocolate torte cake from the grocery store. It's refrigerated. I then realized that, since the pandemic started, I haven't eaten anything without washing it or cooking it first. (Unless it was packaged by machine, that is.) Now I think about the cake and that the person putting the frosting on it, layering it, and doing all the things that make the cake tasty and nice.. and how all that time they are breathing around the cake. Maybe that person is infectious. Then I think how the refrigerator is keeping any coronavirus alive with the cold environment. If the food was room temperature, or if it was packaged by machine, I would think it's ok.

I've had anxiety and worry for this whole crisis. I have thoughts like this, and I can't tell if my caution is rational or excessive. It's frustrating, and I can feel a bit ridiculous.

After years of hard work in therapy, I was able to find a routine to manage it.  I had been making a ton of progress over the last year, and I felt like I had finally left that chapter behind.

COVID took all of that away from me. The routine I needed to manage my symptoms, to give me a sense of normalcy, was taken away.  I was okay the first month, but around week four I slowly started spiraling.  My girlfriend and I were quarantined together, but she broke up with me and I've been isolated for the last week.

Additionally, a friend of mine in LA offered to let me stay with her. We are both young and healthy, and she has a big house and she's been quarantined herself since March.

Is this advisable? Am I beingpletely reckless and irresponsible and putting others lives at risk? I am planning on trying to get a COVID test done before I leave. Supposedly there is an urgent care clinic around the corner from me that is doing them.

3528,"Terrified of overly full hospitals Hi all.

Boy, did my therapist ""pick"" a bad-time to go on maternity leave.

I have severe panic disorder and OCD with health phobias (and an eating disorder and chronic depression, yay). One of my biggest fears is a tooth infection (which I've been fighting off and on since November - currently in the middle of a multi-stage root canal to treat it), another is anything that causes fevers, and while I prefer being at home I get MASSIVELY triggered when I'm ""trapped"" in my house because of past abusive experiences. My therapist went on maternity leave at the beginning of March. I don't have a backup one. And honestly, I was doing bad enough with just the tooth infection and some other issues that I very nearly went inpatient for my mental issues back in December. Ugh.

So, I've not been...doing great.  


I live on Long Island. I've been trying to keep it together. Me, my girlfriend, and my best friend are all isolating together as much as possible. I work from home, and both their jobs are having them not work right now. I've been proud of how I've been handling it - I've been playing Animal Crossing, trying to monitor how often I look up news, and trying to end each round of news browsing with this sub and other positive places. I've not been okay, but I've been....surviving. Coping. Eating more than I expected, which is good. Not in a continual full-on panic attack all day at least.  


I've been so scared of the surge hitting the hospitals though. I got so sad yesterday because I couldn't stop thinking about how many people may die in NYC if the hospitals are overcrowded, even if social distancing works perfectly (the people who were already infected). I kept imagining the scenarios in Italy, which were breaking my heart. And just .... knowing it wasing in NYC and I couldn't do anything...it was breaking me. And I feel so terrible for the doctors. I just...I can't.  


And I feel so selfish. Because I also have a massive phobia of being far away from hospitals or even from a good hospital - even though I'm terrified of hospitals and doctors. (I'm tense all the time, if I think about it, because my local hospital isn't great. And I get TERRIFIED camping or vacationing anywhere that's far from a hospital. Like I'm edgy the whole time.) And now, with how overcrowded the hospitals are or may be, I feel like hospitals just like...don't exist. I feel like everywhere is a remote camping site and I'm not safe no matter where I go. So I've been really selfishly scared, on top of everything else, that I'll either catch this during the peak and not get treated, or another emergency will happen and I won't get treated. And then I feel guilty for being afraid of that, because other people are dying and doctors are working so intensely.  


I'd been trying to calm myself by reassuring myself that Long Island isn't as dense as NYC (at least not out east, where I am). But I got terrified tonight and tried to look up how busy our hospitals are, and it looks like they're getting hit hard too (though I have no clue if they are overrun or if it is manageable). But one has like tents outside, but I'm trying to think that's probably a good thing, that maybe they're preparing and they arent' overrun at the moment. Maybe they won't be. Maybe we've slowed it enough. But I just...don't know.  


So now I'm just...petrified. Like it feels like so close to a breaking point. And of course it's making me feel sick. And I'm terrified of eating anything that doesn't seem ""safe"" in case I get food poisoning. I'm terrified of getting sick. I'm terrified of getting hurt. I'm terrified of falling apart and needing to go inpatient and catching it in a hospital, and either catching it here, or not being able to get treated, or like....taking time away from patients that need them more.  


I'm just so, so scared. And I feel so selfish for being scared about this part. I'm not high-risk (knock on wood, though I don't do well with chest stuff as a rule since I had bronchitis, but I think that's okay? Again, massive knock on wood). Me and my closest people get to be home. I'm not home alone. I'm not a doctor. I shouldn't beplaining. I shouldn't be scared. I shouldn't be so self-centered. I KNOW I'm being ridiculous. (I even, knock on wood, think there's a chance I had this in January. But then I still get afraid something ELSE will happen to me. Ugh.)  


I feel like such a bad person for being afraid for myself. I want the numbers to go down for the sake of everyone, for the sake of those suffering or at risk, for the sake of healthcare workers. But I also went them to go down for my own selfish peace of mind and I HATE that.   


I just want to cry. This is so hard. I've been dreading this part. I'm like....I'm just freaking out and I feel so selfish for freaking out. (And I keep being ocd. Like I keep saying ""knock on wood"" cuz I'm SO afraid of jinxing it and getting sick or maybe the epidemic worse or something because i said the ""wrong"" thing. Ugh. UGH.)  


I want a hug and we can't even hug each other right now :( And i want to help and I just....I don't know how to help. I wish I could go suddenly be a doctor but I don't think I could handle it even if I COULD do it.

3537,"Okay I'm slightly more worried of catching Covid-19 Now. *Going to vent* I know this might be seen as a change in tone but I think Olsterholm and the ""alarmist"" experts could be correct that this will cause equally amount of severe disease for young adults just as it has for older patients. I don't want people to get alarmed and I'm not trying to spread panic but they could be right. 


""Evidence also shows that COVID-19 is more fatal across all age groups than seasonal influenza, with death rates six to 10 times higher for those under 50. Moreover, death isn’t the only danger, and severe cases of COVID-19 are moremon among young adults than you might think.""

This naturally leads me with more questions than previously. If young adults are just as likely to get severe disease and die, why the fuck (pardon my French) did experts release information about who is more likely to develop severe disease and who is not? People in my age range have a 0.2 percent of dying of this disease, that is still less than 1 percent. Yes that is deadlier than the flu but if you have a 99-98% chance of surviving it, the odds ought to be in your favor.

I had never met her and my fiancé didn’t know or failed to tell me that she “isn’t scared” of the virus. As we were hanging out she casually mentioned that she had been at a bar the day before and “it was packed haha”. We were drinking so at the time I didn’t process the info, but it just now occurred to me that she so easily could have been exposed and then came into my home with young children. Another friend of my fiancé is going to the local outlets tomorrow and invited us because *yay crowds!* right? So I realized that he, too, has been the type to not care about this virus and he’s been to our home several times. 

I tried discussing it with my partner and he felt obligated to agree with me that his friends should no longer be wee in our home but I could tell it bummed him out, and if he gets invited to go out he will want to go. So it’s like if ur gonna still be around these people and thene home to us you might as well just continue letting them in here.

3553,"I can't believe MY year has turned into this.. I know everyone is in the same situation. So I feel guilty. Actually in some ways I am better off and that makes me feel worse.

But, there are so many things that have changed in my life as a result of this pandemic and they hurt me and I just want to have a bit of vent. Firstly, I graduated this month. Which is exciting for anyone but I managed to graduate whilst working, two miscarriages, giving birth, divorce, raising a newborn by myself and being diagnosed with a chronic illness. Like, I deserved to walk. It was tough!

Not only that but my fiance and I have been long distance and it has been very difficult.. But we were finally at the end of the visa process and things were looking up. Just had the interview to go which would have been this month and now I don't even know if I will see him again this year. He is my rock. I was moving in July and we were getting married. My parents had everything booked to holiday in his country ande to the ceremony in October and that's all gone.

It is also scary because he is high risk. Renal failure and a few other things so if he gets it he could die. Yesterday I found out his idiotic brother who went out despite everything probably has it and he is just waiting for the test results. They live together and my anxiety is at an all time high. He is staying in a room in the basement away from my partner who is being careful but I am still scared.

Also I feel for my partner as he had just graduated and was looking for full time jobs when this hit. Now he has nothing and his insurance expires this month. Which he needs for his expensive kidney medication to live. He is waiting on his unemployment to process (as he got furloughed) and then apply for Medicare but it is so stressful. It feels like everything that can go wrong will go wrong.

How did this year go from graduation, moving, marriage, finding our career jobs and buying our first home to this?",13,0.84,gbzkuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gbzkuf/i_cant_believe_my_year_has_turned_into_this/,7,Support,2020-05-02,-16,99,-0.16161616161616163

I graduated from high school two years ago, high school was a really awful time, so awful that I took my final year online, which was great but isolating, especially because I can't drive due to my vision, so I essentially can't leave the house on my own. Then I had to take a gap year because of unforseen circumstances, yet another year almost entirely spent in my house, taking care of an elderly dog and dealing with my dad being an alcoholic asshole, then I finally was abe to go to college and it was a really bad fit due to the location and accessibility issues, if I wanted to transfer I needed to take CC classes, so I came home for spring semester and was just trying to power through the days of online classes (my classes were always onine) 

I got accepted to my dream school which was awesome but due to my college going mostly online I decided to defer because the price just isn't worth it, I'm so alone all the time, I'll be 21 years old and a freshman because of the transfer when I start, due to corona I'll probably spend this next year mostly inside too, it's just my room day in and day out, I went to VA beach with a friend, the first person I've seen outside my home in four months, and I feel guilty because almost no one else was wearing a mask or social distancing when we were walking around the shops.

For five years now I've had exactly one friend, failed to start college, been horribly alone, and corona has just cut off any support lines I had, It's just too much.

I've struggled with severe anxiety panic attacks and agoraphobia for years

Talking with my therapist one day she told me about the rubber band technique, it's simple you wear a rubber band and whenever you have anxiety or negative thoughts you snap the band on your wrist and its a good way to ground yourself and focus and bring you back down to earth! 

This helped me a lot but there were a few issues rubber bands aren't very strong so they break often. They also aren't very aesthetic.

So it got me thinking so I made the snap-out bracelet! 
It follows the same principle but they are made of high elastic rubber and silicon so they last and they also look so much better and raise awareness for mental health!

I no longer feelfortable to expose myself like this anymore. I am in the risk group, team members (and boss) are vocally talking about not being fond of vaccines, they openly talk about how these restrictions are unnecessary and that they do not use the mask all the time. 

I am a person that willingly joins in any afterwork activities, but it seems that I am the only one in the team that finds having a team dinner quite ufortable. I don't know what to do. Do I just not go to that dinner, and be left out from the team spirit? Do I suggest an outdoors activity instead? Do I get some courage, go to this dinner and continue being careful?

It is obviously a sound opinion to have and one that I am entitled too. But because I feel alone in this, I am wondering if any of you have found yourself in the same situation?

3635,"Questions about unconventional transmission after a stressful day. Honestly, this could be under support, too, because this was just a draining day. 

So, I have been stuck at home with my family since the pandemic started because the job that I needed to financially secure an apartment never came back. I have been crippling afraid of stores, cars, and public spaces the last few months, while my family has genuinely not taken it as seriously (they use the same disposable masks over and over, two of them got jobs at a mall and a gym respectively even though they didn’t need to, etc). They’ve been doing the shopping. 

One thing I made clear to them was that I really don’t feelfortable having food that I regularly eat touching or near new groceries, as I don’t want covid to spread from packaging to packaging. So, I explained to them that I had moved the food to the far right shelf and my seltzer’s to the opposite side of the garage, so they’d have ample room to put everything else. They had the new groceries right next both my drinks and food anyway, and then screamed at me for the trouble. 

Then later, when trying to decrompess in the basement, I opened the window to get some fall air, only to get the smell of a skunk. My brain immediately thought “if it’s that close, it could be spreading covid droplets through its smell.”

I guess I’m wondering am I the problem? Am I making up ways for covid to travel, whether it be across the floor and pantry or through skunk fluid.

Last Tuesday, I had to take a short flight for work, and returned on Thursday. I took all precautions in both airports, never taking off my mask and staying away from others as much as possible. I got tested on Friday (I realize that this is a bit early to get tested, but I wanted to get it in before the weekend), and it came back negative. On Saturday, I started having horrible sinus issues and hot flashes. I have notoriously bad sinuses, and have recently been diagnosed with allergies that I am still learning to deal with. During my trip, I had forgotten my allergy medication, so it was the first time in a while that I went without taking allergy meds for several days in a row. I also live in a place experiencing horrible air quality from the wildfires. Saturday night, I had very little appetite and slept horribly. Overnight, I developed body aches. I am prone to getting body aches when anxious, and I had spent most of Saturday being worried about COVID, so it could be from that. The body aches and sinus symptoms were gone by Monday, but I went and got tested again that day, and it came back negative again. Today, I have a mild sore throat, achy neck and shoulders, and oddly enough, sore fingers.

I have had no fever, cough, or shortness of breath. I also have not heard of any known exposures from those that I interacted with on my trip. I know that sinus issues are not exactly typical of COVID, but I've seen a few people on here report them.

My grandmother is 87 and has received no visitors since March.  She lives a 6-hour drive from me, I've been calling her every day and making sure she gets a weekly food delivery.  My parents live abroad and are unable toe back to the UK, you guys know the drill by now.  

Yesterday when I called my grandmother she informed me that my uncle David will be visiting her on Friday with his wife and their two teenage sons.  I assume they are all intending to stay in her small, 2-bedroom bungalow but even if they got a hotel that wouldn't make me feel any less anxious.  They'll be taking her into her local town centre to make some non-essential purchases, and as they are serious vultures when ites to freebies I don't doubt they'll try to weasel out a restaurant lunch at my grandmother's expense.  She is very generous and can be naive when ites to people's intentions and openly discussing her finances. 

I'm just worried that it's irresponsible for all four of them to visit.  I understand she missespany but I'd rather she make do with phone calls for a little while than catch anything and have the worst happen.  She's a breast cancer survivor and has always had a very bad chest so the virus would almost certainly kill her, as awful as that sounds.

Last night I suffered probably a nasty sprain or strain. It hurt monstrously, but after ice, 2 Tylenol, and sleep, I felt much better when I woke up this morning. I'm mostly OK, but if I move wrong or remain positioned the wrong way, it's moderately awful. 

I used my insurance's dial-a-nurse, and she suggested going in, without delay. She sent me the questionnaire she'd used, and the red text rmendation to seek care immediately seems to hinge on answering ""yes"" to a single question, to which I don't actually know the answer. ""No"" to this question gets you green text saying home care is OK.

I am terrified that I will catch Covid if I go into Urgent Care in person. If I want telehealth, that requires waiting until Monday. I've called around.

If we were still in the ""Before times,"" no question - I'd be taking my good insurance and going to Urgent Care right now for an actual diagnosis and peace of mind. I used to be uninsured / under-insured, years back, when I would have taken the risk and powered through this sort of thing.

My friend thinks I am over-reacting to the injury *itself*, that I'm OK and should just spend the weekend at rest. Which, knowing me, is possible.

Taking care of her is hard, she does not like to listen and while we try to have her watched 24/7, it is just hard to juggle my kids and school , work, and her.

The loss of taste/smell wasn't documented or reported as a symptom, and it wasn't until late March after I had recovered that my doctor and I put all the pieces together and realized I most likely had COVID, especially considering the people I interacted with whilst sick also lost their sense of taste/smell.

I would be considered a ""dirty socialist"" by conservatives, and I am fine with that.

However, this disappointment at feeling further cooped up...the lack of moving forward further with phases...all the confusing information...yeah, driving me slowly mad. It is all a$$hattery! I also just really wanted to use that word because I love it right now! That's not relevant, but who cares!

I just want to feel free to get out and be around human people again...it will suddenly start to hurt and really crush me all at once, and I crumble into a sobbing heap. I sob and cry heavily for a long time. I've also been getting more and more frequent stress headaches that increased doses of tylenol barely touch, my neck and shoulder muscles are painfully stiff...I wish I could throttle someone with glee. Preferably if the coronavirus were a personified human that I would happily throttle and scream ""This is all YOUR fault!"" Then I would gleefully launch them into the sun while cackling like mad! Yeah! Take that you stupid virus!

I don't care if this post gets flagged or deleted for being and sounding really weird...I know it's allllllll over the place. My brain feels like it is all over the place. I just...I just really want out. Let. Us. Out.

I'm going to go and lay down again because my headache is spiking again. I'm pretty sure it isn't related to the virus. I used to get these types of stress-headaches in the past.

3661,"Would I be taking a large risk? Would I be taking a large risk visiting and staying with my family 7 hours away from where I live?

This is long, so I apologize. 

I live in Western NY where the cases of Covid19 are not very active, at least in my county confirmed cases are low. My family on the other hand, including my parents, brother, sister in law, niece and nephew, live in Long Island, NY where the cases are still very high despite the cases having lowered in severity since April. My parents and my brother’s family live next door to one another and share a backyard, so they’ve all been quarantined with one another, except for the two weeks after my sister in law gave birth to my niece in April. They quarantined separately for that period of time and then joined together again after that two week period. My parents have literally not left the house in 3 months, and my brother’s family has not left the house since they took their newborn to the pediatrician a couple of days after she was born, back in April. They get groceries delivered and have been cleaning absolutely everything theye in contact with, including groceries, mail, and more. They are very cautious and conscientious, and take this virus very seriously. I have also been doing the same. I don’t leave the houses, except I have been getting groceries once every two weeks because I live in a small town and grocery delivery is expensive and hard toe by. I am very cautious because my husband is high risk. I’m also a huge germaphobe with fairly severe OCD (both diagnosed), so I take this situation very seriously. Probably too seriously, my hands are apletely different color than the rest of my skin because of the hand washing, but that’s a whole different story. 

I would really love to visit my family on Long Island, because I want to meet my baby niece and see my parents. I haven’t seen any of them in a long time, and I never would have guessed that the last time I saw them would be it for a while. If I visit, I would drive and stay with my parents. Once I am there, I would not leave the house at all, except to go to my brothers house right next door. I would have to get gas once on the way because my car cannot make it the entire drive (7 hour drive). I would not use the bathroom or purchase food on the way (I have a bladder of steel and never use the bathroom while traveling to visit my family, even without a pandemic, and I have a gluten allergy so I can’t even eat typical traveling food anyway). 

Here’s my biggest dilemma that changes things quite a bit. My parents are driving to their second home in South Carolina this weekend and staying for 2 weeks because all of their summer clothes are located there, and they want to check up on their house. While they are there, they plan on doing basically the same things they have been doing while quarantining on Long Island, aka grocery delivery and deep cleaning, BUT my dad plans on golfing while social distancing, and my mother plans to walk on the beach early in the morning before others arrive at the beach. They also do not plan on stopping except for gas on their trip. By the time I would travel there, it would only have been a week since they will have returned, which is my biggest worry. 

Would I be taking a large risk doing this? I don’t really worry for me. I am 25 years old and healthy and I believe I would likely recover from the virus if I caught it. I worry for my husband (who almost died 2 years ago because of pneumonia caused by the flu and I could potentially be bringing the virus home to). I also worry for my parents, who are over 60 years old but relatively healthy. I would love some input. I’m a very anxious person, and I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking all of this. I don’t want to be selfish, but I don’t know if I can wait to visit my family until a vaccine is available without having some sort of breakdown. I wish I lived closer to them, that way I would be able to just visit outside from a distance but that’s not possible in my situation.",1,0.67,gwwwwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gwwwwb/would_i_be_taking_a_large_risk/,1,Support,2020-06-05,-11,241,-0.04564315352697095

3669,"I can’t keep blaming the pandemic for my shitty behavior It’s me again. In case you haven’t heard from me before, the summary of my story is: I used to live at home with my parents, and in the same state as my boyfriend until winter 2019, when I got a job across the country, but trained close to home. And now because of covid, my ldr is even more painful but I’m also extremely thankful that I’m not quarantined with my emotionally abusive parents.

But now, covid and the uncertainty of the foreseeable future has me rehashing old arguments that we have supposedly worked out. But I can’t stop being angry at what happened before I left. I know I probably wouldn’t be seeing him if I were in my home state anyway. But it barely helps. 

So last weekend, my boyfriend and I were tipsy on Skype and his roommate was in the room as well. And out of nowhere I begin screaming at him about the aforementioned issues and how I was going to drive to the nearest town to sleep with a mutual friend when my state ends lockdown, and that I wanted to break up. But I didn’t mean it. I wanted him to hurt. 

We did discuss it and he knew I was drunk and upset and accepted my sincere apology, which didn’t blame him for anything and waspletely me owning up to my actions. I know I can’t keep being mad at him for stuff that’s done and dusted. And I know full well covid is not his fault. But now he can’t visit and I don’t know when we’ll see each other again.

Small 2-room apartment, unemployed roommate. Partner. Ex. Whatever. (?) It'splicated, but we get along quite great as these ""couple stuck together during Covid"" stories go.

I have been super cautious since Covid, rarely leaving home except for work. He had been 100% on board, and had sheltered in place perfectly.

Until this weekend.

I knew that he would do a little grocery shopping as usual while picking up his prescription from Publix. I had already shopped, and I gave him my remaining list, thinking I'd done the bulk of the work and he'd just pick up a few extra things at this one store. So I dozed off for a nap, woke up...and he'd been gone 3+ hours in 3 separate crowded stores shopping! My state recently reopened, *without* the stats to support the decision, and people are out shopping like mad.

But, hey...he scored us some hand sanitizer! 

I told him I would rather we didn't *need* hand sanitizer, than risk contracting the virus while acquiring it!

He is aware of this post, and says to say he wore a mask. I know his heart was in the right place, but I am frustrated. He's a news junkie, the *good* kind of science-based news. He *knows* better. 

I also should have known better in my own shopping, which was longer than I feel it should have been; but I shopped during less-busy hours, and for less in-store time, also with a mask. I think the instinct here was we were each making our trips ""count."" We're set for weeks toe.

Do I claim a room for 2 weeks while waiting to see that we're both OK? Or am I over-reacting?

3672,"Anxious taking in-person vocal lessons again. This is probably so insignificantpared to all the shit going down. But... here I am.

Where I live, the lockdown has eased the past weeks (with good reason since apparently we got a good start and we seem to have things under some control). One of the businesses that open again are music classes at local spots; I was taking vocal classes at one of those. I was glad some few months ago when they closed because singing (involves spitting etc) in a small room with studentsing in and out and my teacher being in close contact with all of us, stressed me out.

Thing is, these issues haven't been resolved. Covid19 is here to stay. The classrooms are still small. In summer, we usually turn on AC units but this is also dangerous now. We generally have to keep any windows closed so that we do not bother the residents around us.  Very importantly, and I don't know whether other people who sing for hobby or work worry too about this, Covid19 can have a very serious impact on the respiratory system.  3 years ago I had  laryngitis and bronchitis which turned to asthmatic bronchitis. It SUCKED BALLS. I lost my voice for a week and was unable to sing for a year. My whole body was weak for at least 8 months. It took 2 years of work to strengthen my voice to a point I was even better than before. I don't want to lose this again.

Also I have seen no ie these past months and it is unsure when I will be able to work again to be able to afford the classes. I am scared that my teacher (coach, whatever) will drop me but I guess I should better discuss this with her before having such worries. Then again, if I don't take classes now, during summer, then when? Autumn? Winter? We're talking about a second wave of covid19 but also, flu season.

I just.....I don't even know. Skype classes aren't verymon around here and I don't believe they help as much as in-person ones. Singing is lots of things from posture to everything else. And it will require some equipment if we want to be able to have a good skype lesson. But it's worth looking into and discussing it. I used to think that singing classes are like therapy and cost less. It was true.

Is anyone facing something similar? There are other arts like dancing.... when dancing studios/academies are given the green light how will you react? I just wanted this out there.

3678,"question about stimulus package and unemployment benefits I work in essential retail at lowes and im constantly around peopleing in and out of the store. the way lowes works is you are entitled to engage customers that are in your department. regardless of social distancing guidelines you MUST assist customers that need it. The issue is that i am diabetic, asthmatic, and suffer from high blood pressure so i am at extreme risk of dying if i contract the virus. working 5 days a week i fear i will contract it at some point. Ive talked with my doctor and he advised that i stay home which i did.

I took the emergency paid leave offered but the problem is that ends soon and once it does im SoL unless i apply for FMLA. So once the time is up i either go back to work, quit, or get unpaid leave through FMLA. I am thinking about quitting since FMLA is also temporary. The job is not worth the risk. im part time and i get paid in peanuts and my doctor agrees that its not worth the risk and still rmends i stay home.

So my question is if i quit specifically because i am at high risk from the virus and provide documentation from my doctor stating why i am at high risk from the virus would i qualify for the unemployment benefits from my state and government package? I would not be quitting for just any reason, I absolutely can not contract this virus as im not the only one at risk, my mom also has bad health and my step dad is very old.

* Requiring employees to ""clean"" the timeclock after punching in/out with the same set of rags that all employees use all day to clean their cubicles.
* Encouraging employees to work in cubicles with one empty cube in between. This is not possible because of the high number of employees at my location. Even without the pandemic, there's often a line of people waiting for a cubicle to open up so we can work. We shareputers and don't have our own assigned cubicles. The desks are probably 2 feet apart from each other.
* Started an emergency paid sick leave policy with up to 2 weeks of paid leave.

A couple of days ago, my work sent out an email letting us know that someone had tested positive and will be staying home for 2 weeks. They also identified 2 employees who likely came into contact with that person and made them stay home for 2 weeks. They also stated that they've deep cleaned the call center since then.

I actually got sick about a week ago but have no way of knowing if it was COVID19 because I'm ineligible for a test (due to the test shortages, my age of 24, and my low risk of being severely ill). Although since I've had my flu shot and I rarely get sick because I have a good immune system, it very well could be. I've been using paid sick leave days, but that'sing to an end and I'll need to go back. I have to keep going because I live alone and pay my own rent and bills. I get more and more anxious as that dayes because I don't know if I actually got the virus or not, and I'm worried about my coworkers who aren't as lucky as me in terms of age and/or immune system.

My SO and I don't live together (we both live with our parents) but since the day we met we've never spent more than a week apart from each other in 2+ years. It's been three weeks since I've so much as hugged or kissed him and the distance is really starting to get to me, as I'm sure is the case for many couples.

I know there may not be an answer to this question, but does anyone have insight about when it will be ok to have physical contact again? Do we need to wait until we've either both caught the virus and recovered from it, or wait for the vaccine which could take more than a year? Is there any scenario which doesn't involve going months and months without physical contact? I just wish I knew when I'll be able to hold him again.

3686,"A few weeks ago I suffered from both influenza and strep throat and it looked like covid When I went to the doctors office the day I got diagnosed with both strep and influenza ,my doctor literally made me walk through the back door instead of going into the lobby in the chance that I had covid.

Hastily, my doctor swabbed body my throat and nose to use in both rapid influenza and strep test.
We were both suprisingly relived when both tests came out positive as I was able to take both tamiflu and amoxicillin as a treatment instead of potentially getting admited.

What scares me the most now is how easily that could have been covid instead of strep and influenza. as from what I have read, strep throat can cause almost the exact same symptoms of covid-19.

The journey to get down there is about 400 miles, and so during the journey I would need to stop and rest at motorway service stations. I would be with my partner for a week, and then make the return journey back up.

However, it seems to me that having to use these service stations - which by definition would be hubs for travellers on mid- to long-range journeys and many, *many* different people pass through these each day - would put me in danger of exposure, and my personal hygiene is... not the best.

I'm terrified that I would contract the disease, not just for myself but for my partner too. However, there are *extremely* limited options for being able to see my partner, to the extent that we are often only able to see each other once a year on specific dates. As such, we're both very anxious about being able to spend time with each other.

This is causing me a lot of stress, and I'm torn between wanting to see them and feeling like I need to cancel things and stay in the house. I can't tell if I'm overthinking things or if I'm making this a way bigger thing than it needs to be. I also don't know if this is just going to get worse before it gets better, in which case this might be our only chance for a while.

I'm scared for my grandparents and I might be going crazy, because nobody here seems to be taking it seriously enough.

My brothers workplace have a few people still working there, who had direct contact with the virus, but don't show any illness so far. I've seen people go to shops and other public places while coughing heavily. Schools only close once there has been a confirmed case. Everyone is still going to work as usual, because they don't want to stand out and be the first. People living in the same house as me go about their day pretty much as usual, touching food without washing their hands properly, touching doorknobs and directly afterwards going through their face, rubbing their eyes.

They get annoyed, when I mention these things and tell them to be more careful. They agree with me, but don't actually change their habits. Yesterday my brother touched and ate some food without washing his hands first and when I pointed it out, it took him a little while to even remember that he touched it at all. He just cares so little about it that it just doesn't cross his mind and in my opinion it's putting us all at risk.

3724,"I feel like I'm waiting to die I'm in the UK. The virus is spreading again. Mostly due to the government caring more about the economy than vulnerable people's lives. Partly due to stupid, selfish and/or crazy people who won't take precautions to protect other people.

I have a heart condition and a lung condition, and for about six months I was 'shielding'. I had a letter from the government telling me not to leave my house at all. At the beginning of August I had another letter telling me to go back to work. 

So I'm back at work, in a fairly busy shop. I live with my partner and housemate who are both also back at work, in another shop and an office respectively. We live in a very small house and I'm not able to isolate myself from them. So their risk is my risk too.

The government have been bringing in 'local lockdowns' (which aren't actually lockdowns at all, because shops/pubs/restaurants etc are all still open) and telling us not to gather in groups of more than six people. They haven't said anything about vulnerable people who are back at work now. They don't care.

So we're just carrying on working. Doing what we can to be safe, obviously. But we're not safe.

3725,"I’ve been a hermit for 6 months. Anxiety is out of control, and I need to see my loved ones and love interest. How can I do so reasonably safely? I’ve basically been a hermit since February. I have only left my house to go on walks around the neighborhood, go to doctors appts, go to work only when absolutely necessary, see my parents (who don’t go out), and see my closest friend (once at 10 ft distance). I have not been within 6 ft of anyone except my parents (unmasked) and doctors (masked) since February. I haven’t even set foot in a single store or restaurant since February. 

My mental health is really suffering - I know a lot of people are. I will continue to be cautious and conscientious without a doubt, but my paranoia at this point is excessive. If this were going to be over in a month or two, I’d suck it up and continue my hermitage. But not knowing how many more months - or *years* - it could last... it’s incredibly unhealthy for me to allow my anxiety to swallow me like this. I need to get out (safely, but out), and see a limited number of people that are important to me.

I’m thinking about meeting up with the guy I have been dating since last year but haven’t seen in-person since January. He is also pretty darn careful, but unfortunately, his family (who he sees regularly) are not.

I really want to see him. He is important to me, and we have been in limbo for 6 months now. I would love to at least hug him, but I wouldn’t dare have any more physical contact - and I’m not sure I’ll even hug him. 

How dangerous would it be to hug quickly or long while masked? Or to sit across a table from him outside (less than 6 ft) and play a board game? Or to go on a walk masked at 6 ft apart?

Today we are going to establish ground rules with them. We will tell them that these are our demands and that if they do notply, we will not speak with them again. Note that they are generally kind of abusive and both my girlfriend and I have wanted to cut them off for years, but, again, money.

But after trying to relax in bed for an hour it wasn't going away. The more I tried to calm it down, the more it tried to beat out of my chest. After another hour I called 911, the paramedics came and said other than my heart rate being high, my other stats seem fine and that if I wanted to go to the hospital I could. They encouraged me to take my Ativan and rest. But that is it came back, to go in to the hospital. So two hours late, I'm feeling ok. But my heart goes totally bonkers.

I put in a mask and hubs dropped me off at the ER. The screen me for covid, everyone is decked it ppe gear and I get brought to a room. Lucky for me I passed a covid patient (or so I assumed because they had droplet warnings on her glass doors) and was taken to a bed. 

After 4 ish hours, I was sent home. They ruled out a heart attack, blood clots and my lungs looked good.

I'm terrified I picked it up at the hospital. They claim it's not aerosol spread only droplets and that the mask I was wearing would protect me. Same with hand washing.

3758,"Update on Hyper Controlling Roommates Initial Post here: [

Just walked out of my bedroom to see that my (female) roommates new additional ""pod person"" was in our dining room/kitchen hanging out with my roommate and our other housemate who lives in a studio in the backyard. They are a new addition to the pod, aside from staying with us for 5 days straight a few weeks ago before they moved into their own place, but based on our prior interactions, I do not trust them for whatever reason, just a gut feeling and the awareness that they are to me, technically a stranger. In a similar way I guess to how or why my roommates do not trust (and have basically rejected) any person I have proposed as my one pod addition.   


Me and this person, and this roommate are all 24, but the instant I met them, I thought they were maybe 21 at the oldest. Mostly this had to do with how/what they talked about the last time they were staying here. Multiple times, they brought up dating their teacher from high school, dating older men, and things like that to and in front of my roommate and me. This pod addition claimed to be romantically interested in my roommate but prior to this weekend, had not acted on anything with them physically. My roommate was very upset and basically cut it off, I don't know what changed, its not my business.   
   
If I was 24, had a kick ass nanny job, and was able to afford a 1 bedroom studio where we live on that salary, you can guarantee that I would probably be ""responsibly as possible"" dating/seeing other people in my very own place. My roommate even acknowledged themselves that they seem to prioritize dating cis men over queer women, so yes, judge me it's only fair,  but I have a feeling they are probably being slightly dishonest with my roommate, who has the impression they have not seen anyone outside of them aside from the nanny family. I would lie a bit too if I were them, my roommate (see my last post) is unbearable when ites to her approach to trying to control everything and everyone in the house, while making exceptions for herself based in ""science"" and trust in this random person they met from tinder a month or two ago.   


Anyways, I asked this pod addition to please put on their mask while I did my dishes, for my ownfort, I didn't realize they were over at the house. They seem offended, and my roommate scoffed at me and said something like ""excuse me but ---- is my pod person and they are allowed to be in here without a mask on"" and basically tried to tell them not to put it on. Of course, this personplied. As I quickly did my dishes, I thought about what would have happened if I had brought over my pod person unannounced with what my roommate call ""their consent to exposure"", I do not think it would have gone over well, as the last time I saw my current semi pod addition (if you can call it that) outside of the house I was shamed by them. My roommate then proceeded (she went to Harvard and intellectualizes everything) to tell me that me asking their person to wear a mask while I was in the room wasn't even ""scientifically accurate"". Lmao. I'm so over the hypocrisy.   


In other news, my cousin, who lives across the country, tested positive alongside all her roommates at college. My aunt and mom broke this news to me, I'm not sure I should reach out, maybe she is embarassed? I do not want to shame her but she is obviously going through it.

3759,"Why aren't kids wearing masks in schools in the UK? I just posted a few days ago after arriving in London from the US. I was shocked to see that very few people are wearing masks here, even indoors. Restaurants and bars are open for indoor dining with no table spacing or precautions taken.

After being in the US, New York, and other parts of New England through the beginning of this, the idea of not wearing a mask inside of a building with others is... unthinkable. I understand being outdoors and walking past people on the street has very low risk, but when you're inside, the risk increases exponentially.

Masks aren't perfect, but if everyone wears them in public spaces, the risk of spread is cut down significantly. Anything is better than nothing.

So I'm even more surprised now to see that schools near me in London are not requiring any kind of face coverings for their students. Schools are in full swing. I walk by a few each day that has their students piling into the building without any spacing requirements. I was told that everyone is having their temperature checked but... remember... kids don't tend to get severe illness. Young people are much more likely to be entirely asymptomatic. So why should kids have to wear masks in school? *Because they're going to go home and give it to their entire family.*

Sure, I'm annoyed that my neighbors have been throwing house parties, but that's so much less significant than schools being in session.

And then that goes back to the wearing of masks in public spaces - being young, having friends in New York who are also young, knowing how we are, I think that honestly, if you live on your own or with others your age and don't tend to interact with elderly folk, if you wear a mask in public spaces and follow basic hygienic precautions, what you do in your own home is your call... schools, however? These are somewhat mandatory institutions that play a massive role inmunities, families, etc. Schools need to reopen so that parents can go back to work... but they're going to be the exact drivers that bring the disease back to the workplace, via the student's parents.

Am I missing something? I really don't understand what people are thinking at the moment.

&#x200B;

EDIT: And I absolutely don't buy the ""you can't make kids wear masks""... you can make them wear uniforms... when I was young you could make girls conform to specific dress regulations by publically humiliating them or sending them home if their straps were too skinny or their shorts were too short, even though it was brutally hot and there was no AC in the classroom... so why can't you require them to wear masks in school?",7,0.77,iq111x,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/iq111x/why_arent_kids_wearing_masks_in_schools_in_the_uk/,6,Questions,2020-09-11,-8,164,-0.04878048780487805

Last week I was out and had to stop at coffee shops a few times. I avoided people and went to places with single stalls. Low risk, right?

She also said the tests don’t mean anything and even if it’s negative I still have it even though it’s not typical and I have no other symptoms. 

I am confused because another doctor on telemedicine who prescribed me had told me it is a GI issue and not suspicious of COVID. 

The doctors visit gave me a huge amount of anxiety and I had a panic attack with chest pain. Now I have lingering chest pain and crushing anxiety and i feel like I’m going to die of covid next week. 

However, my boyfriend who has been with me shows no symptoms and went inside all the same places as me.

I have plants by the sidewalk that I have to hand water and people are out walking, or walking their dogs or jogging or with their kids and there's two sidewalks and a street but they just want to walk right by me without a mask.

 It makes me tense just trying to relax and water my yard. Every damn time. Even if I see theming and watch them no one wears a mask and if I didn't move they would just walk right next to me. The other day I watched some woman jog toward me and thought she would move then I had to ask her to move and moved myself just to barely get out of the way while she jogged past and was friendly but totally didn't get why I'd ask her to just go in the empty street. I get it, I could move, but for crying out loud, I'm standing there just trying to water my plants. 

The point is no one seems to take this virus seriously. In my state masks are mandatory even outside now. I'm just sick of feeling tense all the time. I should just be able to be in my yard without worrying about people getting too close to me. It's not a lot to ask.Our street is nice, it's a nice neighborhood, the sidewalks are really close together, the street is small, they could just walk around me. Most people see me and continue on their path. I want to thank the few people that go around. It sucks. I would go around if I saw someone in their yard. I should be able to just relax out there while minding my business without being on the constant alert for people all the time and it sucks.

 I follow every single rule I can not to get sick and other people just don't get it. When I take my kids on their bikes it's the same in our neighborhood. Peoplee right up behind me. My husband hates taking our kids on their bikes because it's so damn stressful for the same reason. Okay.

3763,"How do you deal with family members guilting you into breaking isolation? Daughter wants toe home, i'm at risk. (Posting on behalf of my Mom, who is having a hard time dealing with my sister's insensitivity) 

My daughter is 28 and lives in NYC. She wants toe home to have a nose job. But, i'm 60, my other child has OCD/Anxiety, and we're both at risk in several categories. She wants toe here, to South Florida, where cases are rising and showing no signs of slowing down, to get a nose job.

She said she would be open to quarantining before surgery, but, we would still need to expose ourselves by taking her to her pre-op appointment, bloodwork appointment, and the surgery itself. It's an hour north of us so we would have to stay in the area while she's under, so we would need to eat and use pubic facilities, something we aren't open to doing just yet. 

She has options, both her uncle and her father offered their apartments and to take her, and take care of her, and we'll see her from a distance, but she is adamant about wanting toe to our house specifically. I feel bad for her, but she's making me feel even worse. Calling me selfish, saying I need therapy, saying i'm not ""living"". 

I feel like a bad mother if I shut the door on my own daughter. But i'm scared. And this isn't a medical necessity or a priority right now.

3764,"Question around the whole mask under nose thing -? I grew up wearing masks (lived in japan about 10 years). 
Right from the beginning I was aware masks were intended to protect others from your germs (wife and I wear them on planes even before this pandemic and when we sick) 
What’s confusing me is the topic of the masks under the nose. 
Masks don’t really protect the wearer. It’s a social responsibility and it helps you not spread your germs ... whiche out through the mouth 

So I’m confused what the reasoning is for why people get upset about the mask under the nose? 
It’s still protecting other people from the person’s mucus expunging germs .... being the mouth primarily. 
Granted I’m sure if the person gets sick ... and by uncovering nose i assume it increases THEIR chance of getting sick.. that’s just more opportunities for them to get others sick when they out and about .... increasing the length of time this whole stuff keeps going ...
But based on how I was raised it’s perfectly fine to have it under the nose - my school friends and I use to wear them under the nose sometimes when we were sick in the early 2000s in japan, and my wife (korean) and her family in Korea often wear like that if ufortable. 

Sorry, again at the end of the day just wear masks. I’m a supporter. But I’m confused about this part. I even asked my doctor and she said honestly she had no idea. She thought it had more to do with the psychology of it (if under nose likely to do other stuff halfway too that could get disease) because mucus doesn’t expunge much from nasal passages.

So I went to work for the first time in months on Monday and Tuesday. My coworkers frequently took their masks off, but I left mine on the whole time and kept my distance from them for the first part. There were a few occasions where I did have to go near them while they had their masks off to get supplies during a lunch rush though  (I work at a cafe and actually posted on here a few days ago). I was never exposed to them for more than a couple minutes at a time, but one coworker got back from a trip to another COVID-heavy state three weeks ago.

Now, I've got post nasal drip and a headache. I live with my 50+ mom in a small townhouse, so I've quarantined myself in the one semi-unused room in the house, but I still feel like there's a huge risk. I'm prone to sinus issues and there's been a huge change in air pressure due to iing thunderstorms where I live, so I'm hoping it's just sinus issues, but I'm terrified this is COVID.

I'm not asking for advice or a diagnosis or anything like that; I'm just asking for a little bit of support. I've struggled with anxiety since I was a kid, and being trapped in this room is making my thoughts run wild. I'm so scared.

Just taking 10 mins out of your day without any Internet, could be whenever your in the shower of if you work out, just after then, and finding 3 solid positives in your life right now and just repeating them to yourself.  It could be things you have started since in isolation like picking up an old instrument, or even reaching out to friends and family that you wouldn't normally have done if it wasn't for the situation.

What are your positives right now?  Mine would be:

1. Reconnecting with my family who I'm isolating with. I haven't really seen in the past 7 months or so. My little brother is now a full blown teenager and it's shocking me every day more and more how much I haven't seen him.
2. I've picked up some new software and I'm learning a lot about concept art, games design and animation (for anyone interested in that kinda stuff, there are a lot of free to use software up there which are taking the industry by storm and actually being used in mainstreampanies, will link some in the description)
3. So far no one who I actually know has been infected (I know this may not be the case in 3 weeks, or even a weeks time, but it's right now that matters)

3774,"Bf is too anxious about covid19, and it is dragging my life down as well. update

Thank u all for ur support!!! You are the best! I tried to talk to him again and got him to open up a bit. He didn't apologize initially, just explained that he was upset because during the last 2 days, I mentioned takeout several times. I should have noticed he was not happy about that but I kept on babbling about this topic and it was very insensible. Then I tried to explain takeout is safe especially hot ones. He didn't buy it initially. But after like an hour, he came over and apologized. Apparently, he talked to a few of his friends and even the most cautious ones ordered takeout a few times. 

\------

(Hope this is the right place for this question. )

We have been dating for 2 years. He moved in around when covid hit. It was fine in the beginning until he started fighting me about covid19 constantly. Mostly just he fights me as I don't like conflict so I usually just ignore him and wait until he calms down. But recently, things started to get intense even I lost it once. Just to clarify, I am not reckless. I wear masks since March, frequently wash my hands, avoid going out or meeting other people. But these seem not enough in his standard.  A few examples:

I had a dental cleaning and consultation for a root canal and crown before covid. I kept postponing it until my state is relatively safe and my dentist guaranteed her strict sanitizing protocols. So I told him my tooth is bothering me and I want to see a dentist. I also motioned a lot of my colleagues had started going to dentist appointments, so it is probably safe now. He exploded instantly. He started swearing. ""You totally don't have anymon sense. Stupid b\*\*\*\*.. Why you need to go to a dentist, it's not an emergency. Who cares about your colleagues, they will get covid and die. If you really like covid so much, go to one of those covid parties and if your lucky enough get your immunity then go to your dentist. Don't give it to me."" In the end, I had to cancel my appointment and I'm not sure when I can reschedule again.

Recently, we went hiking. It was nice and refreshing and we were both in a good mood. On our way back, I said maybe we can order some takeout since we were both tired and there was not much left in the fridge. He exploded again, even worse this time. ""You know how dirty those takeouts are. Who knows if they wear masks when cooking? If you like infectious disease so much, go get yourself HIV or whatever you like."" Then he went ranting about how insensible, ignorance. inconsiderate I am. How he made a huge mistake moving into my apartment because he thought I was a more responsible person.

Now whenever I try to talk to him, he's always like ""You can do whatever you like."" without even looking at me. Lately, he only eats instant noodles we bought months ago. I have to eat so I go to grocery stores and ordered some hot soup once. I was so afraid he might shout at me again when I brought back the soup.

I understand we should take covid seriously. However, it will probably take some time before everything is back to normal. Essential parts of life still have to go on. With my current living situation with my bf around, I am constantly walking on the thin ice and I'm getting more and more anxious and depressing.

3775,"Presumably positive andpletely devastated/not knowing how to cope Hi  everyone, I (30M) want to share my story  because I have literally nowhere else to go. I started feeling bad (aches, fatigue, nausea) on Monday 13th (after I was out a lot the  weekend before) and it continued getting worse with eventually SOB and chest pain starting around Wednesday 15th. That was also the day I got  tested, however the test result came back negative on Saturday 18th.  Before and after that I was at the ER a couple of times where they took  blood samples and also did an XRay of the chest, saying there was  nothing there. They always sent me back home without prescribing me  anything, although I told them how hard it was for me to breathe and  that I actually (on Monday 20th) felt like dying, that I was not gonna  make it (the SOB was first worst at night, when I tried to sleep or it  woke me up in the middle of the night or in the early morning, however  on Monday 20th it got really really bad during the day).

Eventually,  out of despair and because I was not being helped (but just sent back  home) at the hospital I contacted me GP, because I felt I had to take  things in my own hand to prevent the worst. He prescribed me an  antibiotic and cortisone, which I both took and symptoms slowly got  better (they're still not gone though, however I actually managed to get  some sleep the last couple of days). Now of course I don't know whether  me getting better is because of the meds or because time has passed (I  started taking them on day 10 of my symptoms), however at this point I'm  just glad I did.

Yet I'm really  angry at everyone (the doctors, my family and my girlfriend), because  all they kept saying was that it must be panic attacks and that I should  relax. Well easier said than done, when you feel like there is a stone  in and on your chest and you're simply not getting enough oxygen (also  my arms and legs sometimes startet to feelpletely numb). I feel like  I should have started the meds ways earlier and that this might have  prevented this really bad progression of the disease. I know my PCR came  back negative however there seem to be a lot of false-negatives and I haven't done a CT-scan yet either, so I also feel like itspletely unprofessional to rule out Covid, like the doctors basically did in my  case.

Well anyway, here I am now,  feeling like an 80year old (I used to be very athletic, running and  working out is key in my life) withpletetly fucked up lungs, and  whilst I'm already better than I was a week ago, I don't know whether things will ever be like they were before, judging from what I read  about this desease and the long-term effects it can have.

I am an adult and live apart from them with my husband and kids and at first it seemed we were in this together but as time went on it got so political and we find ourselves on opposite ends. My family, as in parents and those younger siblings still living at home, have been going anywhere and everywhere it seems. My dad may be working at home now but he visits the home improvement store every day for supplies. My sister and mom went a trip an hour away to visit elderly friends and shop at a few stores. Masses are canceled but my brothers still went and sang in the choir for the online masses, and my parents sat in the front row of the church. this kind of stuff. They're not gridlocking the capitol, no, but finding a way everyday to leave the house that seems unnecessary. 

OK, that stuff was worrying enough. I care for their health. Then my mom started pushing me to hang out, she misses my toddlers. I politely said we should stay contactless for the duration of the stay home order and that it sucks. She didn't even bother replying - but got together with the rest of my siblings who have moved away from home. OK. OK. It sucks and I don't agree but it's their choice. 

Now I find its my extended family too. Every day I see in texts or social media that my family, aunts, uncles and cousins, are just blatantly breaking the stay home order. I have seven aunts and uncles and like thirty cousins on my moms side. They've all been seeing each other and going places and seeing their friends. But also they're being asses. about wearing masks or not (mandatory now in our state) and making jokes like ""gretchen didn't catch me."" it's childish. 

I found out that my aunt and cousins from states away came to visit my parents last weekend. What??  they didn't even try, it feels like?? And - Are they all seeing my grandma??? She lives across the street from my parents. I'm worried for her ugh

This morning in the family group chat I found out two of my siblings went on a road trip a few states away, to another state with a stay home order. Everyone just chatting like it's normal - yay they made it, looks like you all are having fun! And it's triggered a panic attack for me.

Having to wear masks in public and maintain space, the restrictions inside restaurants, the lack of public events, online school, its all just fucking annoying. Plus the vaccine being around the corner most likely makes me feel impatient, especially when I see all those articles that suggest all these restrictions will have to stay in place even after we get vaccinated. I understand why social distancing is in place and I adhere to it the best I can but I'm just irked all the damn time.

3796,"I Hate People Sometimes (Rant) I feel like Ie here to vent a lot lol but it keeps me sane. I hope you're all keeping sane, too.

We recently decided to start seeing close family again since we spent months in isolation. Yes, we know cases are spiking. Everyone in my area just kinda seems to live in an alternate reality where there is no Covid. ""There is no war in Ba Sing Se."" It's also Trump country, so I guess that's part of the problem. So, when we realized that we were the only ones following the rules and all that, we gave up. I gave up my life for months while everyone around me partied and carried on. I'm sorry, but one person can't make a difference in a pandemic. A movement, trend, or art? Absolutely! But not in a pandemic. A pandemic requires a cast majority of cooperation and that just is NOT happening here. Blah, blah, blah muh rights. 

Anyway, my mom came to visit me today. She rarely gets out as she's disabled and cares for my disabled brother. I gave her some stuff that I'd been meaning to give away and it made her day. Here's where the shit kicks up; she goes home and her asshole boyfriend is there. This dude is just THE definition of a dumpster fire. He's a pill popping, booze sucking, welfare king and there's a good chance he's inbred, too. Dude is mean as a rattlesnake. He starts in, saying he has Covid because he doesn't feel good. He gets my poor mom all upset and she calls to tell me. This dude is a drama king from the bowels of hell, itself. The Kardashians have NOTHING on this fake ass shit smear. He throws tantrums when my mom does ANYTHING she wants to do without his trifling ass. So now, he's on the Covid thing. 

I work, and I'm lucky as fuck to be doing so right now. I had plans to see my partner this weekend and keep working on the house as I'll be moving in soon. And this bent nosed motherfucker wants to throw a wrench in it all. I work my ass off and my damn taxes pay his for his booze habit... And now he wants my weekend, too. 
So, I'm responsible. I told my partner about it and asked if he could isolate after seeing me until I can get a negative test back. I was told I could get a test through a local service, but they turned me away because I don't have symptoms, even though I told them I was JUST EXPOSED. They don't care and THEN THEY CHARGED ME FOR IT. 

Guys... There is NO testing in my area. I can't miss work to make an appointment and get a test and wait a week for results... Like, what the hell is this? A Clockwork Orange? What kind of dystopian fuckery is this??? 

So, I think I'm just going to go ahead and see my bf since I can't get a fucking test anyway. I can't slam the breaks on my life, especially work. I'll be honest. I think my mom's bf is full of shit. This dude is straight up impacted. He got mad because my mom had a good time and now he's lashing out. 

Ugh. I'm so sick of it all. I'm hella respectful of my surroundings. I wear a mask from the time I start my work day, until I clock out. I wear a mask when anywhere in public. I wash my hands. I use hand sanitizer, even if it smells like chocolate and oranges, which, ew, who decided that was a good smell? Who are you? Why are you like this? Eugh. Anyway, if I end up with it, I will be doing my best to keep it to myself. That's why I wear a mask, anyway. To keep others safe. Even if I'm the only one.

:: UPDATE::

So, my mom had suspected that he was dehydrated because he literally never drinks water and alcohol dehydrates people. She said he was pissing brown. So, I told her to make him drink 1 glass of water every 30 minutes. She called back after about 4 hours and said he is feeling much better and doesn't ""feel sick"" anymore and his piss is light green now. He was all gushy and thanking me and I wanted to puke. Dude had my nerves wrecked because he can't even fucking drink water the right way. Bruh. I've had it with today. Y'all have a goodnight.

Swapping between work and childcare throughout the day, sometimes juggling chasing after her while being on a work call, has been so difficult. My husband and I had been juggling a part-time nanny and work when she was younger (a decision we made because it was a temporary headache we could manage - we were ufortable with daycare when she was only a few months old) and had switched to full time daycare a little while before this pandemic started. We were starting to get into a groove. It has been so long since I’ve felt like myself. I had severe anxiety during pregnancy (she’s our little miracle IVF baby - treatment was a psychological stress in itself) and postpartum anxiety after she was born. We have no family nearby either so help postpartum was nonexistent. 

It’s just...this constant state of alertness (fight or flight) has been my “normal” for so long. I’m extremely burnt out. I’m physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. 

I’m in therapy but the stress of the present and new anxieties about the future are just too much sometimes. I’m so tired.

3801,"On the bright side Of course, there are still some very challenging times ahead with regards to COVID, but there are also some potential upsides.  As a result of the downtime that we are all experiencing, I expect there will be several upsides which we will proportionally recognize in theing months:

* Less traffic accidents and deaths due to less cars on the road (in a normal year \~[35,000]( road accident deaths per year in the US)
* Less work deaths per year (\~[5000]( / yr)
* Less cases of Influenza due to handwashing, social distancing, etc. ([estimate]( was up to 63,000 deaths)
* Less instances of e-coli and othermunicable diseases due to handwashing awareness
* Less STD's due to isolation

In the longer term, the increased education, awareness of best practices, and fear will lead to ongoing reduction inmunicable diseases for the next year (or until we all forget....)

Possibly more importantly, indirect benefits wille from researchers seeing COVID-10 as a goldmine - a unique worldwide event which will be used to draw many conclusions.  I bet thousands of PhD's wille from COVID-19:

2. when to close businesses

3802,"My fight against depression during the time when our world needs us. So. What is depression. My vision of depression is a limitation on your mind. It emerges slowly but surely. It affects your mind by limiting your imagination to reality. Every single thing you've experienced in your life is part of that limitation. Everything you've ever felt is part of that limitation. What would it feel to remove that lock on your mind. Think so far ahead. Way beyond the limits of our imagination and mortal shell.Our sole being is brain. When you unlock the potential of it. it will change the way you see the world.  

So, How do we visualize this. Imagine it's a lamp with glass container. What does the container do? It keeps the toxins your mind is emitting from releasing. What if we could remove that container? What would our flame look like? Flame which could burn freely, passionately. That would be a sight to behold. Now that you've that image in your mind. Now think of the words glass container and the flame in your image. Glass container is your depression. Flame is your mind. If we remove the container. Our mind unlocks it's potential.  

I would visualize my feeling of curing depression like this. I felt one with the universe. Universe also felt one with me. It felt like an out of body experience. I saw myself as more than just a human. I saw myself as one being belonging to a higher entity. Looking back to my birth and as far as our extinction. Everything just made sense. As i've spoken about my experiences after feeling this out of body experience. Everyone just marks me as a crazy person. As if i'm having psychosis. But i'm not. My ideas i have after winning the battle against depression. Those ideas just feel too real. Like i know it's right. Other's think its fantasy, but now in my mind everything is a possibility. Everything we've ever done is a culmination to something. What is that something. How could you know. Humans can't visualize things beyond our bodies capabilities to realize our idea. What if you could be connected to everything. Mind to mind. absurd amounts of possibilities rise.

We have been doing virtual learning since the spring and we will be returning to brick and mortar schools very soon. I am struggling to decide whether I should return. I live in an area with one of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the country, but our state government is not taking it seriously and lifted virtually all restrictions.


Schools are reopening in less than a week and I have been given no information on how I will do my job, how many of my students are returning, how I will be protected, how much contact I will have with students etc. I work with very young children with disabilities so many won't be required to wear masks. Many of them don't understand the concept of social distancing, may wander around the room/elope, and don't understand how to cover a sneeze or cough. My principal and the school board have basically said that you won't receive amodations to work from home unless you can prove that you will die if you are infected.  I also know that temperature checks, plexiglass barriers, and air filters are not allowed.


I have an emergency fund so I can afford to take an unpaid leave for a few months. I'm just having a really tough time deciding whether or not to return because I have no information. I am  reluctant to take the plunge because I don't feel like I have a ""valid"" reason to do this. Though I am technically not ""high risk,"" I am concerned about getting ill and the potential long term consequences on my heart and lung health even if I do survive. 


However, I also have people telling me that I shouldn't leave a steady job when so many are out of work. My employer is also making me feel like something is wrong with me because I'm not in the highest risk category and I am still afraid to return.

3857,"Hostile and Uncooperative Brother... I'm suffocating Hi.

First of all, this group has been helping me immensely throughout this pandemic so just general gratitude about that.

Right now I am living back home with my two parents and my 33 year old brother after living abroad since the pandemic put a halt to my plans. He is also living back home due to financial instability.

My brother has created (and has always created) a very hostile, negative, aggressive environment in the house. But it wasn't until moving back home and having to stay home with my brother again that I've realized how horrible he is. He gets extremely upset and aggressive (yelling, name calling, door slamming, manipulation, humiliation) every time me or my mom ask him politely to do anything (wash dishes, lower the video volume, be cautious when going out etc).

He had foot surgery earlier this summer which has kept him from going out but now that he's recovered, he's talking about going out partying and he's going out way more now (beach, restaurants). He is a very irresponsible and reckless person so I don't trust that he will be safe and mindful when he goes out. Both my parents are at-risk (old age/asthma/diabetes) so I'm scared his recklessness will cause a potential tragedy in our house. We share the same bathroom and I have grown increasingly nervous to use the bathroom since he's been going out more. 

I don't know what to do. I feel really suffocated and really at a loss. Every day it's a battle with him. My anxiety has skyrocketed sinceing home to this living situation. I'm past the point of helping him (anytime I mention therapy as a solution he responds w aggressive words and behavior). I've placed my own boundaries for my own mental health but it's so hard since our house is so small and we're always at home. He's supposed to be moving out soon but he hasn't even been looking for a place or finding work or anything.. and bringing it up to him backfires to abusive behavior.

I was sick for roughly 2 months, with severe cold like symptoms. No shortness of breath or loss of smell, but most of the other symptoms. No hospitalization.

While the bulk of the symptoms have long since disappeared, I've had a painful sore throat and a mild cough since then. It's been roughly 6+ months now. I've seen 4 different doctors, but none of them have been able to help.

I've been taking heartburn medicine with meals (on doctor's suggestion) for a few months, but it hasn't helped. I also don't get actual heartburn, and my diet is pretty mild. I've been taking anti-mucus meds as one doctor suggested a mucus build-up can lead to throat irritation, but it hasn't made too much difference, and I still get phlegm (though not enough to spit it up or anything). I also tried alergy meds for a month or so, but again, no help. I've avoided foods that cause phlegm buildup such as dairy. Lot's of hot tea and chicken soup to ease the difort, but it's only helpful while I'm consuming it, and quickly wears off.

I'm looking for any advice or suggestions from people who have had similar symptoms and difort. After 6+ months of a sore throat, I'm at my wit's end. I just want this to end, but I can't find any helpful advice, either online or from medical professionals.

These grandparents are following the rules - seeing people only outside, wearing masks, not really going anywhere.  Neither live in a hot spot. We go to the grocery store, but otherwise everything we do is outside or in our house (alone).

We have a second grader and online school was a disaster. He attends a very tiny private school that started back in-person this week. Ten kids in his class and 10 kids in the other class of his level are all one cohort. They wear masks all day and sanitize their hands what sounds like constantly. They are doing outdoor class as much as possible (still masked). A lot of the parents have talked and everyone seems to be careful, like we are.

Our % positive here has gotten quite good. Today in The Boston Globe it says: *The seven-day weighted average of positive coronavirus tests was .8 percent as of Thursday, which is the lowest that number has been since the start of the pandemic.* (I read the COVID posts in the /boston subreddit, which  gives us a higher % positive).

They both have mild high blood pressure (me too, actually). Dad smokes (ugh). The flu sent his body into a crazy state 2 years ago, but after that the doc said his heart/lungs - everything looked great.

They would pick up our kid one day a week, take him to their house for 3ish hours or so. They are not worried. My partner is not either. I, on the other hand, could let myself spiral into serious anxiety. Half of me feels like we're being very careful all around and the risk is quite low, especially given his school and where we live. Like intellectually, this sounds like it could really be OK. . When we didn't see them for 3-4 months, my mother was getting super depressed and I think at this point, she thinks we need to take calculated risks to continue to live our lives and this is the most important one to her.

We don't have an intimate relationship, but we do share a bed due to space issues. I aming to thismunity for advice and support because my roommate and I have different ideas of how to best go about life during a pandemic and I would like input on whether or not I am being unreasonable in my requests of him. 

I have approached COVID-19 with extreme caution since back in February, when a coworker with a background in medicine warned everyone at work that the pandemic wasing. ""Staycation 2020"", she called it, and told us that we would remember this time for the rest of our lives. She implored us to rigorously wash our hands frequently and keep a wide bubble of personal space. The seriousness with which she approached COVID-19 from the very beginning, and the fact that her predictions were correct, make my resolve to follow her example nearly unshakable. She does not go in other peoples' homes and wears a mask at all times when in the presence of others. This is what I am doing and what I have asked my roommate to do, and this request has started to take a toll on our friendship.

My roommate is polyamorous and he has a couple partners, who are also polyamorous with other partners. I have asked him to limit his contact with them to socially distanced dates outside with masks on and to abstain from physical contact since we share such a small space. He has begrudgingly agreed, but his partners all think I'm being controlling and unreasonable and I know he agrees with them to a certain extent.

I also feel like he's always trying to find loopholes, so he's still ""technically"" abiding by my requests, but not actually social distancing. The other day I joined him at the park with one of his partners, and at first it felt safe - we sat a bit apart and we all wore masks. Then, imagine my surprise when his partner pulled out a joint and they both took their masks off to share it! I was absolutely flabbergasted, and even more so when he said that he felt like he was still honoring my requests since they put the masks back on after finishing the joint. How does that make sense??

I've known my roommate for nearly 10 years, and up until a few months ago I thought nothing could shake the foundation of our friendship. I feel disrespected and helpless, but I know abiding by my requests to the letter will make him feel the same way. Our relationship is strained and I'm feeling more like a nagging mom than a friend.

So I'm here because I'm starting to panic. I knew that if I got infected I'd get put off work for a while and I dreaded it but it happened and now I'm self isolating and its been almost 3 weeks.

Basically i am struggling with lockdown and my perseverance and patience are staring to wear thin. Im from the UK and i havent seen anyone apart from who i live with (partner and our 2 year old) since a week or two before lockdown started because we wanted to be cautious early due to my mum and dad both having health issues that would put them at risk. 

Both my mum and dad have received letters advising they shieldpletely, my dad has be furloughed and they havent left their house. At first, this was okay. After the first month it got hard. 

My partner is an essential worker and as such is still working full time, so i am often alone in the house with my child, who i love so much but she is constantly go go go, she has such high energy its unreal. Shes also always stuck to my hip, VERY clingy and its gotten worse since lockdown tbh. As such she throws tantrums as soon as my attention is not on her, and has made it extremely difficult to keep up with housework or anything really. 

Im aware it sounds like i amplaining over trivial things and should just get over it and get on with it. But i have been suffering anxiety and mild depression since my daughter was born. Things were improving before lockdown, but now my head is a mess. My mental health has plummeted. Its such a nightmare to try and do anything round the house that ive ended up just giving up, and now i am buried in housework that im struggling to catch up with. i know its sounds so stupid because its just housework but its making me feel even worse because i feel so incapable of basic tasks. Even when my partner gets home or is off there are only so many hours in the day and im so depressed that im struggling to motivate myself to do much.

For the last few weeks, ive had several occasions of breaking down and crying because i just feel so alone, overwhelmed and stressed out. I have never felt worthless before in my life, but recently at my worst points i feel so useless and worthless that its scaring me. 

Yesterday i absolutely lost it with my other half over almost nothing and i just broke down. I called my mum and cried and cried and i felt awful cause i know my mum will worry but i just needed to have someone 'with' me, i didnt want to sit and cry alone. My partner is very supportive btw but at that time we'd just argued so i didnt want him tofort me. I told my mum that ive had enough now, i cant do this anymore. I feel so isolated and its killing me. 

Now to get to my real dilemma. My mum and dad have asked me to send my daughter to their house this weekend for a day to give me a break. I feel so in two minds. I am really starting to fall apart, and i really need a break. But my mum and dad are both at high risk of serious illness from covid :( ive spoken to them about this and they are both adamant that they are okay with accepting that risk, they miss her to death anyway and they can tell im struggling. But my partner works in a shop and although we take all the precautions we can, im still scared to send my daughter to my parents incase we are infected and dont know.

It could quite literally kill them. And i feel like such a selfish bitch for even consisering it, but i really am because i dont know how much more i can take. 

So, would i be a selfish, inconsiderate dickhead if i let my high risk parents take my daughter for a night? 

I duno if it makes a difference but i will list the precautions my partner takes with working -
Frequent hand washing, sanitizer and disposable gloves are provided in work, he doesnt work on tills, the shop only allows 3 customers at a time, the staff keep their distance from one another and the customers. When hees home, all of his work items are put in a bag and left untouched until he goes back to work, His uniform is washed immediately after every shift, he washes his hands, disinfects his phone and then gets a shower. He does not touch me or his daughter or anything until he is clean.

Edit to add that where i live our current r number is around 0.8 if that makes any difference",2,0.75,gx9qr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gx9qr1/would_i_be_extremely_selfish_if_i_let_my_mum_and/,19,NA,2020-06-06,-47,263,-0.17870722433460076

Despite him being really cooperative these past few weeks staying indoors and keeping a distance from family/friends, I feel as though I've been acting like I'm his mom through all this. He's known to make questionable decisions sometimes, especially when ites to disappointing people and I just don't want him to rush into planning this party for fear of letting his best friend down. On one hand he's a grown adult and can make his own decisions but on the other hand his family and friends don't understand how serious it could be for him if he contracts the virus, so they tend to downplay it and laugh at him for being so careful.

3909,"Corona relapse I'm writing here because maybe someone else who has had this disease might be able to illuminate something about my present condition. 

I live in Edinburgh, Scotland in student amodation...beginning on  Friday, the 31st of January, I started to feel very tired. By the next day, I had the usual symptoms of a cold: congestion, a mild cough with yellow phlegm, and a bit of a headache. I was not concerned at this stage, and I kept functioning largely as usual, even though I was a bit knackered. There were no documented Corona cases in the area at this time, but I live in student amodation surrounded by students recently returned from China. I presumed I did not have Corona, because no cases were reported, I had no fever, and my cough was not 'persistent'.

These cold-like symptoms continued, but by following Friday, began to improve. My cough had disappeared. On Saturday, I was feeling mostly better, went out for a walk, did laundry that I'd been putting off whilst I was sick, and cleaned my room. That night I got hit like truck by new symptoms. My heart start racing, I had horrible aches and pains. I had night sweats where the whole bed became wet. I felt tightness in my upper chest. However, somehow, I was able to sleep. On Sunday, my symptoms lessened in the morning, but by night, they came back with a vengeance. I was up the whole night, my heart racing, with shortness of breath, nightsweats and aches and pains. I still had no fever. That morning on 10 February, as soon as I could I rushed to my GP, who conveniently has his surgery across the street from my flat. I had never experienced anything like this before, and I wanted to know what was going on. He took my blood pressure, it was high, but he said that was nothing to worry about. My heart rate was only slightly elevated. He said my lungs sounded fine, even though I was winded just by holding my breath as he used his stethoscope. Because I have a history of anxiety, he presumed I was having a panic attack or something like that related to my health, and that I'd just suffered a minor viral infection. He prescribed Propranolol. I never agreed with this anxiety diagnosis. As an 'anxiety-prone' person, I know the difference between anxiety and physical symptoms. However, because he said I was not 'in danger' of dying or anything like that, I went home. I rested, and my shortness of breath eased up a bit. My heart bined with the upper chest area) still felt really odd, but not as bad as before. I took the Propranolol for two days, but it did nothing but give me cold feet, and I was certain it wasn't going to help. As the week went on, I rested, but waspletely knackered, with horrible aches and pains and nightsweats. The shortness of breath did not return, but my upper chest was always achey and tight. On Thursday and Friday, I had stomach cramps. I also started to feel this strange 'bubbling' inside my chest, and a 'buzzing' inside my legs. This is one of the strangest symptoms I had. The buzzing is so bizarre...my legs are not shaking, or anything, but I just feel this internal 'buzzing'. In any case, I was continued on, still no fever, no cough. That weekend on Saturday-Sunday I had what felt like a relapse. Again, my heart started racing badly, I felt tightness in my chest. I didn't sleep at all Sunday-Monday, and again went to the doctor. I tried to explain that I'd never experienced an illness like this before. A cold never lasts this long, and a flu normally has a fever, and certainly it doesn't mess with your heart beat. He took my blood pressure and listened to my lungs. My BP was higher again, but not at a 'dangerous' level, and he said that was likely just a normal variation. My lungs he said sounded fine, and my heart rate was slightly elevated, but he said when he exercises at his age his heart beats faster than that. He tried to pinpoint where the pain in my chest was. He pushed under my breast area, and I found it very sore. He said this was an indication of muscleoskeletal pain, rather than a heart or lung issue. He said I just needed to go home and rest. So, I did. I rested for another week, and was able to sleep until the weekend again, though symptoms continued, when I had yet another relapse, though this time milder. I went to the GP again on Monday, and said, this is not getting better, it's clearly not normal...what's going on? And he said, I'll do a blood test and a ECG. I had those done. My ECG was normal, and this was a relief. Clearly whatever strange pain I was having, and my sometimes racing heart, were not going to kill me. My blood test showed slightly lower white blood count, and this was put down to the infection that I had had, but everything else was normal, except for slightly elevated bilirubin, which the doctor put down to gilbert's syndrome, because my other liver markers were fine. He ordered a followup blood test in a week's time. I continued to be extremely tired, aching allover, with strange pain in my chest, and buzzing inside me. But, the symptoms began to get milder. I thought I was getting better. When I had my next blood test, my white blood cell count had recovered. However, I continued to have bad and good days. By the 8th of March, however, I made close to a full recovery. I still had aches and pains, particularly in my upper chest, but by and large, I started getting back to normal.

Unfortunately, as I was getting better, the world itself started to get sick. Everything went into lockdown, etc. We all know what happened. I haven't exactly been enjoying these weeks on lockdown, but I was happy I wasn't sick anymore. I started to wonder, however, whether I had had an early case of Corona. In the early days, a fever and a persistent cough were required in order to be considered for corona, but we increasingly learned that for some people this was not the case. I had never experienced a sickness like that before, and I came to be certain that I had probably had a 'mild' case, the shortness of breath being the biggest hint. I was probably exposed from Chinese students returning after Christmas break. However, I was not able to be certain, and I took all precautions, staying inside and washing my hands.

However, starting this past Sunday, it seems like my symptoms havee back. On Sunday, I started to have a headache, and a bit of congestion. Then, on Monday, I had horrible headache and nausea. More importantly, the tightness and pain in my upper left chest returned. I had trouble sleeping again. While my headache somewhat recovered on Tuesday, on Tuesday into Wednesday I had the peak symptom of my previous illness...I couldn't sleep, with tightness and pain in my upper chest, and real shortness of breath. I could still breath, but it was painful, and I needed to focus on my breathing. I made it through that night, and here we are today. I still have no fever, no cough, but the tightness in my chest is bad. The shortness of breathes and goes, but isn't as bad as it was last night. The buzzing in my legs and bubbling in my chest, which had been gone while I had been feeling better, came back. WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON?

Did I have Corona, and am I now relapsing? That's the best explanation I cane up with. I did not expect this, but I don't know what to do. I can call the doctor, but because I don't have a fever and a cough, I don't think he'll take me seriously, and in any case, only hospitalised people get tested in the UK now....I have no idea what to do. I am sorry for the long post, but I am hoping that maybe some other sufferers who have been tested can shared some information, so that I can figure out what to do....",2,0.75,g1tly2,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/g1tly2/corona_relapse/,16,Firsthand Account,2020-04-16,-91,460,-0.19782608695652174

I have made a stock pile of masks that I've been giving out and stuff and she has one. 

She wants me to sit with her on the deck of her house several feet apart (the deck is about 20 feet wide). If we both wear masks and sit far away from each other, is that still safe? 

I'm currently living with my grandpa, so I wanted to know. 

She's been really upset lately, I can tell in her texts. I'm very worried about her and about our relationship. 

I want to be there for her and also keep myself, her, and my loved ones safe. 

My masks have three layers of cotton and are washable. I am planning to donate a whole lot to hospitals, police stations, and fire departments. I have already fitted my family with them and am trying to get some to friends. 

I have been depressed, as well, with not being able to see her and of course the stress of the pandemic, uncertainty about my future both career wise and, honestly, survival wise, and we also sustained some storm damage recently. I feel like the world, itself, is shitting on me. 
I have not been eating nearly enough because I just can't make myself eat. I feel weak, sleepy all the time, sad and angry almost all of the time. I'm not who I used to be. I used to weight lift and I was fit, but I've lost so much weight and I feel like actually trash. I don't even sleep anymore, and when I do, I have nightmares about my future falling apart or losing my fiance or loved ones. No, I can't afford a therapist. Yes, I have mental illnesses, too. Yes, I do have hobbies. No, I can't do them right now, even the indoors ones. I can't afford supplies and I couldn't get them anyway because the stores are closed. 

No one in my area is taking it seriously. No one is doing anything they've been asked to do. My snap is full of people at parties, drinking, and playing music. People don't social distance in public. Masks aren't popular, yet. No one uses hand sanitizer or washes their hands (from what they've told me). 

I am the only person I know literally torturing myself to do shit safely and it has greatly impacted my mental health in a super negative way. I'm scared of a lot of things. I am irrationally angry and I actually havee to hate people, now. 

Anyfort or help or whatever would be nice. I have nearly nothing left and I could end up with even less. And why would that be worth having? I hate my life right now. I'm so sad. I'm so angry.

3911,"Should I continue going to work or staying at home? Hi everyone, 

I have an issue here. My dad and I had a lengthy ""discussion"" (really a butting of heads) about how he does not want me to go to work anymore because of Covid19. But I disagree with him and feel the need to go to work because I have no choice as I'm working an essential job. I want to go to work as I feel like I shouldn't be held hostage to earn an ie because of Covid19. I actually like working at my job and would rather do that for 10 hours a day currently than to stay under quarantine with my dad who has at this point basically be paranoid and panicky about the virus which he was not a few weeks prior despite only watching the news and not going into any further research at all about it until the US started seeing a spike in cases. He watches the news everyday (mostly CNN) and keeps track of the number of cases and deaths, minute by minute. I've told him that he should try not to follow the news so much especially at this time. But he won't listen so yeah. That's where the problem lies for me as I have not been paranoid or panicky this whole time and have tried to maintain a calm head in this whole situation, not only for myself but for everyone else in my family. 

I work in a warehouse with 8 to 10 other people and they've taken our temperatures everyday and have strict guidelines. I'm a fit, young healthy male in my 20s who exercises regularly and takes vitamin D every morning. I take precautions such as wearing a mask, hand washing everyday, etc. With that being said, I know I'm not immune to Covid but I think I'll be fine. 

He doesn't seem to understand that and is now saying I'm being ""selfish"" for still continuing to go to work. He doesn't understand that I've been taking precautions and looking at content from reputable sources like everyone else (which he knows I have and I was actually the first person in my family to start thinking about the impact Covid might have by buying the necessary supplies back in Early March and doing the initial research) when I take the bus. He says it's not ""enough"". I even mentioned I could get a coworker friend to drop me off to and from work before I start having enough money to get my own car. Not ""enough"" he says. Not only that but he has not taken into consideration that I can't just ""stay home"" like everyone else. I'm not a white collar office worker or a college/ grade school student so if I ever decide to quit my job because of that then I will not only be further behind financially and job wise but it will take me another 3 months to find another job after this lockdown is over and who knows when it will be. I don't ever want to do after having gone through that ordeal back in December 2019. Again, he's called me selfish and berated me for not caring about my two younger siblings despite me doing the research initially and basically consuming content from reputed sources (the news imo is not a reputable source and only feeds into the paranoia and fear. That's another story). He always seems to frame this into the ""greater good"" whenever I have my own personal interests at stake and says, oh well what about your youngest siblings or your mother or your family"". ""You're the oldest sibling here"". He don't really care about the impact this has for me, honestly. I don't want to quit and feel like quitting would be a ""I told you so"" moment for my parents and I refuse to do so as it will give me the strength to persevere through tough times as I have before. 

He's basically givien me an ultimatum if I decide to go back to work which is I should get my own ""room or hotel or Airbnb"" which is further confirmation he doesn't want me to go back to work. He knows I can't afford one at the moment and is using it as a scare tactic. He has a minor in psychology so I know what he's doing even if he tries to deny it. My mom is not off this too as she berated me also for going to work and said ""I don't go out much at all anyways"" so why should it be a problem for me to be in quarantine, she says. Again, she's said this nonsense before and I know exactly what she's trying to do here just like my dad. She works as a manager in a grocery store with far more people yet she wants me to quit when my little warehouse has a little over 8-10 people at any given time depending on which managerse in and out during the day. 

I'm honestly just tired of the BS and hypocrisy and self righteousness from my parents regarding this situation. I'm an adult and last time I checked, should be able to make decisions regarding my job without them having to play silly mind games and toying with the only stable source of ie I have at the moment. I have a second source of ie which can earn me enough in the future maybe more than the current job I have but I can't really do much with that one at the moment. Will they pay for my expenses (ie, phone bill, cable bill, credit card/college debt) once I quit my job. The answer to that is a big fat No so I think they should cool it a little bit.  

I can't do it anymore with the people in my personal life anymore especially my parents as I've be persona non grata in their eyes. Everytime Ie home, I get stared at with contempt and have to constantly spray down everything from the outside including my shoes and other pieces of clothing. I get no praise or support for having to wake up at 4am every morning and work 10 hour shifts at my warehouse during such a time from my parents/family members. Nope, just beratment and constant guilt for working during this time as if I had a choice to do so. And then my dad has the nerve to ask me what I did with my tax refund for me to justify working during our ""discussion"" as if that has anything to do with anything. But again, I know what he's trying to do here. 

So I'm here to get a non judgmental assessment from people who aren't in my personal life about whether I should quit my ""essential job"" or stay at home like everyone else? I think about this disease everyday and it's impacts and did so way before it was talked about en-mass. I need an honest assessment and what I should do based on my current situation. 

Apologies if this was such a long post/vent but I needed to get this off my chest since last night. 

Thank You. 

Edit- I'm honestly afraid of being locked down at home with my dad and getting constantly lectured for not doing much in my life so far despite taking steps to do so. Also having my every move being watched. I'm afraid of being berated by mom for leaching off of her. I have too much pride for that which get from my dad's side. I also have depression and anxiety and I feel like that will make everything worse. I'm afraid of returning to the person I was 2 years ago.

Update- I've decided to stay at home. I literally could not sleep while trying to make this choice. For my family's sake and for the public's sake, I couldn't risk myself going to work while knowingly or unknowingly having the virus.

F20, CA USA little background about this situation: first of all i work at a movie theatre which means i was already exposed to different people. i had co workers that were also getting sick but not sure how bad. around the same time i became sick, my whole family did too, only one of my brothers that i know of tested positive for the flu. we all had flu symptoms and a cough but they didn’te down with it as bad as i did. 


feb 12, i began developing a slight minor cough that started out with wheezing, later that night i felt a bit hot but it went away, i also had head congestion that night. 
- days went by and my cough kept progressing and getting worse and worse. (i don’t recall between this time if i kept feeling getting hot flashes)

feb 22 i developed a high fever along with my cough, although i didn’t check how high it was i know it was pretty high enough to give me hallucinating and or confusion symptoms during the night when i went to sleep. my cough at this point was already terribly bad. i would cough constantly day and night to the point where my chest was in pain and my throat became sore and irritated. i was also coughing up a bit of phlegm. 

feb 24 i visited my doctor, got tested for the flu and came out negative. they checked my temperature and although i was still getting chills and feeling internally hot, my temp was normal. he ordered an x ray to check my lungs to make sure my cough wasn’t developing into pneumonia but i never got my x ray done to this day. 

march 12: i was still coughing a bit but it was nearly gone by then.

Right when i got here I started having a runny nose/facial redness/ sneezing/phlegmy cough... typical allergy symptoms. Also the pollen here is so bad. But i literally cannot smell/taste anything. I took a sip of bourbon and all I could taste was the mild burn of alcohol...

I had a call with my doctor today and she said that the lack of smell/taste is most likely a sign of the virus and I probably have a mild case of it. She said it's in my nose area now and will move to my lungs soon. That's what scares me the most. I'm so worried I might have shortness of breath or trouble breathing.

3923,"New here. Hello all,

27M. Thanks to the mods for the approval.

I dont know what to feel or think thru all this. I watch the news everyday, and I just assume that it'll be over in a month. Maybe I'm just too optimistic but i just want things to go back to normal.

I would say the hardest thing about all of this is missing my parents. I live just 10 miles away, but i would feel awful if i visited and something Happened. they're both in their 50s and thats enough for me to stay away. I would see them every week before any of this, and now this is the longest I've ever gone without seeing them. Sure we facetime, but its just not the same.

Then theirs the worry about me getting the virus. I'm a fairly normal 27 year old, besides the fact that i had cancer in 2018. Currently in my 2nd year of remission; never had to do chemo. So i wouldn't categorize myself in the immunpromised category. it is putting a damper on my yearly checkups, my doctors are doing phone-calls rather than seeing me in person, and I guess CT scans are being limited to emergency scenarios. I feel like not only do i have to be paranoid about my cancer returning, but now I'm paranoid about getting corona too.

On the bright side of all this, I'm still employed as my industry is allputer work. and my fiance is also working from home. We're set to get married in 2021, but now I'm wondering if it'll all be over by then.

3924,"My best friend has it, his fiance's father is currently in the ICU, I think I may have it too now, on top of other things. I have (or rather had) a friend who was one of those idiots who thought ignoring the quarantine was a good idea, meanwhile i'm in the worst hit area of the US. She gave it to my friend, and somehow it bypassed his fiance but got her father, who is now on oxygen in the ICU, and most likely not going to make it. My friend who now has it also has severe asthma. I believe I have it as well, because i've had odd symptoms here and there, coughing fits, body aches, chest pain, but chalked them up to anxiety, as I have severe anxiety and panic disorder in the best of times. My father has severe COPD and is a goner if he gets this, but I have nowhere to go at the moment. He's also still out in the world, working, as he's essential. but he's pushing 60 and has COPD.

On top of all of this, I ran out of my anxiety medication because the last two weeks have been so stressful, and my doctor refuses to renew my script early or up my doseage (i've been on it for almost ten years, with no incident) and I can't get it until the 4th, which means i'll be going through withdrawls on top of rebound anxiety on top of stress from this whole situation.

Even before I ran out of my meds, I had flu-like symptoms, chest tightness and body aches, and i'm only 27. My immune system is also garbage, I get the flu or a very bad cold that leaves me bedridden at least once a year. The symptons my friend has and the symptoms I think i'm feeling line up with the incubation time, because we know who the idiot who spread it is, and can deduce our last exposure to them.

I already suffer from anxiety and panic attacks in an extreme manner, I have clinical depression, I most likely have covid, my best friend has it, his fiance's father is dying from it, and for all I know I already spread it to my family without knowing. I was denied a test, my friend only managed to get one because he works as a psychiatric counselor.

I don't think I can get through the week of hell toe, between all of this sickness, unsureity, the benzodiazepine withdrawls that are already starting to kick in, not knowing if I have it or not.

Friends have labelled me ""wacky"" because I care very much about washing your hands regularly, using hand sanitizer in times of epidemics (flu season etc.), but it was always in good fun.

Now, with SARS-CoV-2 going around, I'm scared. I'm a 33yo male, stopped smoking a little while ago, and I'm a Hypertonia stage 2-3 patient — it's a family thing. I take ACE inhibitors as per my GP's advice, but must admit I've been a little lax with adherence lately.

My live-in girlfriend works in a hotel as a receptionist, so in my country (which is in lockdown), she still has to go to work. I'm very worried about her, too, because I love her, because she lives far from home (she's from another country) and her insurance is pretty crappy.

What bothers me most is my current flatmate. He'll move oute end of May, but he's your typical ""it's just a flu, stupid panic everywhere"" person. Never really washes hands, still goes out for parties, has his f\*\*kbuddies over.

3938,"Need help/info regarding my wife and my dad. So I live in Ohio near Lake Erie in the suburbs. So my wife and I take care of my parents. They aren't homebound or anything that really requires us per say, but my wife (not from America) believes in taking care of your parents as they age.

My wife is 35 and had PTB about 7 years ago. She was treated with a harsh regime of drugs in the Philippines and cured. But the doctors in America looked and told he it trashed her immune system. She works at a local Amazon plant (thankfully shes wearing a mask, washing hands...etc). So I am nervous about if she would be ok if she got COVID-19.

My bigger concern is my dad. He is 66. He's had alot of health issues. Every winter he always gets sick and cough, I don't think they ever pinpointed what it was. I do know his immune system isrpomised. And on top of that he was diagnosed with Leukemia. Can't recall if it was Chronic or Accelerated. He's on meds now and they are split on the line on if this new med is doing much.

So my obvious questions are should I worry about my wife? And what about my dad? He mostly stays at home, but he does have doctor appointments this week and almost every other week. He also has a pending surgery (on a cancel list).

Seeing there are three cases now a few cities over from us, it's made me nervous. I know for the elderly its only 11% death rate. But I remember them saying immune system issues and what not are of concern.

3953,"Anxiety/antidepressants are just a band-aid In the case of Covid, antidepressants only mask the fear. They make you appear acceptable and normal in the eyes of yourself, your family, and friends. Deep down, the fear and anxiety is still there; you just feel numb to it, and better at hiding it from yourself and everyone around you. Meds don't prevent anything other than overthinking and catastrophizing all the time. However, if you're a hypochondriac like me, a headache, a throat tingle, a cough, a sneeze, a muscle ache, etc. can set off the anxiety all over again. You wonder if this is it-- if this is finally the first sign of your health taking a downturn for the foreseeable future, if you've infected family members at home, and if this is just the beginning of your Covid nightmare. You know that if you get worse, and if you test positive, the anxiety will likely rear its ugly head as if you weren't on medications at all. 

Covid anxiety isn't like social anxiety or claustrophobia, and it cannot be reasoned away with logic. It's a fear of something very real and potentially quite formidable. And one of the worst parts about it is that it can be difficult to get the warm,passionate help you need with the social distancing standards in place. Sometimes a hug and reassurance that everything will be okay is all you want, but you don't want to potentially give or recieve the virus by hugging, and you know that everything might not actually be okay. Whether you're afraid for your own health or life, or your loved ones' health and lives, Covid anxiety is real and it's scary. Medications and therapy can only do so much.",8,0.76,irollh,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/irollh/anxietyantidepressants_are_just_a_bandaid/,2,Discussion,2020-09-13,-13,85,-0.15294117647058825
3954,"Did I do the right thing? I’m in the low risk category and was dating someone for about 3 months that I really like but broke things off solely because I wasn’tfortable with his covid bubble of 10+ whereas mine is 1-2.

I get my groceries delivered, I work from home, I don’t see my parents unless I haven’t been around anyone for 2 weeks and only see 1-2 friends once a month doing a socially distant activity. 

Him on the other hand, sees about 10 friends regularly, goes to the gym, works in an office, goes food shopping and still sees his family. When he hangs out with friends, he does outdoor dining or he’ll go inside their houses. 

I’m not seeing friends regularly because I’m choosing not to whereas he’s seeing his friends multiple times a week. What bothered me about that is he’s interacting with a lot more people than I am which is contradicting what I’m doing to stay safe. What’s the point of me avoiding hanging out with groups of friends when someone I’m dating isn’t? His germs are getting passed to me. 

Anyway, I didn’t think ending things would affect me so much. I’ve been really upset and I miss having him around. I’m second guessing myself now and thinking that maybe I’m being too paranoid. I also see some of my other friends post of Instagram going out and about which doesn’t make me confident about my decision. I did bring this up to him and his response was that he needs human interaction on a regular basis. Finding a good guy is hard toe by so I hate feeling like I might’ve missed an opportunity.

Goggles, a 5+ layer mask, a full spray off of all my possessions and a scalding shower when I get home. I refuse to get COVID, I would rather die than have it, and I would rather be jobless than need a COVID test.

My best friend was trying to reset his sleep schedule yesterday, and I got to spend the whole day with him. At one point in the day he severely stubbed his toes and they swelled. At the appointment to get them x-rayed, they discovered he had a very low grade fever, and he had to get tested for COVID. The results will be back in 3-5 days but he's fairly confident he doesnt have it. I spent most of my time with him yesterday wearing a mask, though took it off in his room and his car.

3961,"Some Info on Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) during COVID-19 Hey guys! Intimate partner violence (IPV) is something that could be impacting the people around you. This pandemic is stressing relationships more than ever, and I thought that I could shed some info on IPV after a specific lecture on it in a course I'm taking this summer. Please be aware that IPV can occur to anyone, not just women. IPV could occur in a newly-minted relationship, or in a 30 year marriage. It can be even moremon in LGBTQIA+ relationships. Partner violence is chronically underreported and can be detrimental to the survivor.

&#x200B;

*\*\*\*Trigger warning\*\*\**  \-> This topic can be triggering for those who have been in an abusive relationship. 

&#x200B;

**What is intimate partner violence (IPV)?**

* IPV is a variety of abusive behaviors that one person uses against their intimate partner to isolate and humiliate them; often, the main motive is ***power and control***
* EX of IPV could include:

1. Intimidation - displaying weapons, physically destroying property, making the survivor afraid
2. Coercion and threats - threatening to leave, tomit suicide, to do illegal things
3. Economic abuse - preventing them from getting or keeping a job, restricting access to the survivor's ie
4. Male privilege - treating survivors like a servant, defining roles based on gender
5. Children - making survivors guilty about their children, threatening to take the children away
6. Denying and blaming - denying any abuse, blaming the survivor for the abuse, not taking the survivor's concerns seriously
7. Isolation - controlling what survivors can/cannot do, who they see/talk to, limiting their outside involvement
8. Emotional abuse - humiliating survivors, making them feel guilty, putting survivors down

&#x200B;

**Barriers to Support + Resources**

* distrust of authority/law enforcement
* lack of knowledge about available resources
* mixed messages about healthy/unhealthy/abusive relationships
* constant pressure to be in an intimate relationship
* confusion of legal rights and how that ties in with resources (EX. undocumented immigrants)
* lack of confidentiality of relationship and personal information
* feelings of shame, anxiousness, depression, and isolation
* survivors can share close social groups with their abuser

&#x200B;

**COVID-19's Impact on Support + Resources**

* law enforcement response has changed (EX. courthouse is closed, police are overloaded, etc)
* shelters are unavailable, more limited, or are in unsafe places
* fear of going to the hospital
* new set of ""tools"" that relate to COVID for abusive partners
* lack of confidentiality in homes, especially in lock-down/Shelter-in-Place
* increased amount of mental stressors (EX. more people are on edge, which can lead to the desire to take control of others)
* less access to supportive social networks

&#x200B;

**How to Support Survivors**

* Empower them; help them find their own voice
* Provide options and advocate for their choices; don't push your perspective on them
* Don't trash talk their partner; it may prevent them froming to you again for help because of your negative reaction
* Do your part to end the pandemic! Ending the pandemic can open up support offices, enable more face-to-face interactions, and provide more resources for survivors, etc
* Be the person in the group that often points out what looks like a ""healthy""/""unhealthy""/""abusive"" relationships; spread your knowledge to other people, who may not even realize their partner is hurting them
* Keep in mind that IPV can occur in waves for many people; one day their partner is loving, but on other days, they can be abusive....this makes it really confusing for survivors and bystanders alike

3962,"Struggling with my husband’s COVID anxiety This post is mostly to vent but also to seek support during a trying time. 

My (35F) husband (38M) is a germaphobe and has hated hospitals his entire life. Back in March, we had our first serious talk about COVID and he basically said that if he catches it, he does not want to go to a hospital for treatment, no matter how bad it gets. He essentially said he wants to just die at home if he catches COVID and gets very sick. He also said he wouldn’t visit me if I went into the hospital. 

That was hard to handle/react to. 

He is also stressed due to a less than-ideal work-life balance right now in his contract position as a software engineer. He’s recently be the breadwinner for his father and step-mother, whose ie has been drastically reduced due to COVID restrictions in my father-in-law’s line of work. He had a breakdown from burnout and financial stress back in April and I literally thought our marriage was ending. 

At the worst of it, he told me he didn’t have the energy to deal with me (I had been having near daily breakdowns) and that he just needed me to not be anywhere near him for a while so he could get his head on straight. 

He and I have yet to really talk about what all happened, excluding some superficial talk of how he can avoid burnout again on this new contract he started two weeks ago. 

Which brings me to today’s issue, that has my whole being caught up in a whirl. My grandmother (86) has been at an assisted living facility for years now and they’ve done an excellent job keeping COVID out of the facility. Grammy really wanted a haircut, though, so she asked me to take her to a salon so she could get it cut. 

I wasn’t terriblyfortable with the idea of her going to a salon, and my husband was pretty angry about the very idea of it. Before I went to pick her up this morning, he told me to tell her, “ I really don’t appreciate her endangering my wife.”

And then I got home from taking her to the salon. She was the only client there the entire time, and I stayed in the car while she was seen. I showered immediately upon getting home but noticed my husband was a little more withdrawn in his home office than usual. 

I always make us lunch. Lately, he’s been really good abouting out of the home office during his lunch break so he gets a good solid break in his workday. 

Today, when I sort of caught him in the hallway after visiting the restroom, I asked if he had any requests: “No, I’ll get something myself.” And went back into his office, closing the door behind him. 

Cue my heart falling. Tried to brush it off, to not take it personally, maybe he had a rough morning and just needs some space to dpress. 

5 pm, his usual “I’m done for the day, let me spend some time chilling on the couch with my wife before she starts making dinner” timees and goes. 6 pm, I knock on his office door. 

“Don’te in here, stay in the doorway. I don’t want you to make me anything. I don’t want you near me for the next three days. You can thank your selfish grandmother for possibly exposing us.”

Cue my heart breaking. These next three days are going to be hard. I texted him, basically begging him to not ignore me while I keep my distance. And his response didn’t even have an “I love you”. 

Sorry this is so long, I just really needed to get this out. It hurts my heart so much but I know he’s just reacting from anxiety about COVID. It’s hard to not take it personally. I hope no one reading is going through anything like this. It sucks.

Edited on “Day 2” to add:
He is extreme social distancing from me while in the same house due to my possible exposure to COVID despite everyone wearing masks (and the high likelihood my grandmother didn’t pick it up in the salon somehow anyways...). We thankfully(?) have a full guest suite next to his home office, so he’s been able to sequester himself. We have exchanged I love yous multiple times and he’s even checked some things off our Before Trying To Conceive checklist, namely, doing research on cribs and strollers, so I’m on a rollercoaster of emotions, folks. 

He and I are definitely going to have to talk seriously about all of thise Tuesday. I am still waiting to hear from a friend who’s a Physician’s Assistant about her rmendations for therapists, but I’ve looked up Marriage and Family Therapists near us who accept our insurance. My next step is to research which ones are offering virtual visits so I have a list of options for him to choose from.

Insane chemistry, a night of dancing, an inside joke after only a few hours together...and then the world ended. After a month and a half of social distance dating, she broke it off with me suddenly and without explanation.

I'm looking back on that date now and wondering if it's the last time I will ever experience true joy. Everything that brings me joy in life is gone now and I don't know if it will ever return. My favorite karaoke bar closed for good, dancing is too dangerous, and movie theaters may be a thing of the past. I'm beginning to think this pandemic will never end, especially due to our piss poor leadership and all the irresponsible chuds in this country who think the virus is fake news. If we have to live like this for years and years, we will get used to it and never go back. I can't imagine a future where social interaction is something that only occurs over Zoom, and where my wedding, child's birth, and even funeral have to occur virtually. A future where people always wear masks and treat other human beings like ""the floor is lava"" isn't living. It's literally hell.

One of the most painful things about this recent breakup is the fact that she told me people need 10 hugs a day to be healthy. The way things are going, we'll be lucky to get 10 hugs a decade. The thought that this pandemic will never end and is going to fundamentally change the very fabric of what it means to be human feels extremely real and is chilling me to the bone.

Hugging, chatting face to face, no masks etc.  My Mom texted my sister (who was in one of those groups) that she should've been more adamant in separating from them because they haven't been taking any precautions. 

My sister, in front of everyone announced ""I'd rather take the risk than look like you"" and pointed at me.

It just felt like such a dagger. I was so embarrassed. To be judged, by my sister, for doing what we can to protect ourselves and reduce risk is so harsh. Especially within reason too. It's not like we're wearing hazmat suits, we weren't even wearing masks because we feltfortable with how spread out we were. Apparently, it's asking too much to social distance these days.

I just feel so judged by everyone every single day.",20,0.84,j0dlbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j0dlbl/id_rather_risk_covid_then_look_like_you_my_sister/,6,Support,2020-09-27,-6,62,-0.0967741935483871
3976,"Feeling increasingly at odds with neighbors and fellow citizens of my city/state as schools open Long story short, I'm in Louisiana, still the highest per capita case state. 

We've been 95% quarantined since approximately March 12. All groceries delivered and sanitized (though less so since fomites revealed to be less issue.) Had two social visits at distance and outside. We do spend alot of time in the forest and occasionally pass other hikers but consider that risk minimal. Otherwise, other than 1-2 times, we've not even entered a store.

Anyways, I am very firm in my decision that my son will not be returning for first grade next this month and that I intend to homeschool him indefinitely. 

With this decision, I suddenly realize that we are far in left fieldpared to our peers. The head of his school tells me that 90% of students are returning which I find baffling and extraordinary given that 2-3% of the state's population has tested positively for COVID already and the risk, despite some murkiness about kids role in transmission, etc, seems far too high to take. 

In sum, we've been doing OK but suddenly are feeling way out of step and sort of left to fend for ourselves. 

We considered setting up a pod but found it nearly impossible and then decided it might be too risky anyways. 

We are definitely OK and tested negative last month. But we could use some moral support in the schooling decision. 

Solidarity.

edit: Someone asked by PM - we are a family of 3 (38F, 44M, 6M). 44M has a mild autoimmune disorder and is considered ""high risk"" by some authorities (ie, was barred from participaring in Moderna study) but not most.",20,0.84,i3glrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/i3glrm/feeling_increasingly_at_odds_with_neighbors_and/,2,Support,2020-08-05,-5,114,-0.043859649122807015
3987,"I feel even more unsafe from COVID-19 now than I previously did And the reason is because the news came when President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, tested positive for COVID-19.

I mean, I know he had iting to him after almost a full year of not wearing a mask at all, not socially distancing himself from other people, and holding crowded, cramped rallies where his own crowds wore no masks and were under six feet from each other, as well.  But it just makes me even more scared because if it can infect the PotUS, then all it did was make me even more scared of leaving my house even with a mask on, as well as scared of my family going outside of their own houses and contracting COVID-19 themselves, anyway.

It also makes me scared of America, as well.  Like, is Joe Biden infected with COVID-19 himself, after that debate he had with Trump?  Is America going to fall into even more chaos now than throughout the past four years of Trump's presidency?

I'm scared right now, and I need as much support as I can get to help me get through this.",11,0.87,j3wmej,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/j3wmej/i_feel_even_more_unsafe_from_covid19_now_than_i/,5,Support,2020-10-03,-7,56,-0.125
3988,"I’m freaking out and on a verge of a panic attack I am a teacher. I have major anxiety around Covid. Tomorrow is the faculty’s first day back to school (just meetings, no students). My school’s policy is that people can take their masks off when they are 6 feet apart. I disagree with this policy, as viral particles can remain in the air for a while. But that’s not really the point of this post.

I have two hour long meetings tomorrow in our schools auditorium with all of my colleagues, where the “masks can be off if you are farther than 6 feet” rule applies. I know a lot of my coworkers will take this opportunity to take off their mask, and I am absolutely freaking out over it. I feel like the odds of me catching the coronavirus are up like 10 thousand percent from these two meetings, especially at an hour long each. I don’t understand why they are allowing this, but I’m too new of a teacher to really say anything (it’s only my third year there). I have a kn95 mask that I will wear, but I don’t think that will be enough. I can’t calm down and I don’t know what to do.",13,0.88,ilexjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/ilexjn/im_freaking_out_and_on_a_verge_of_a_panic_attack/,9,Support,2020-09-03,-5,58,-0.08620689655172414
3989,Protests Hey there I'd like to get your opinions how long to wait to visit with people* who are going to be going to live protests. is there a certain amount of time they should wait before getting tested for covid and then I should wait after that?

3990,"Will this never end? I'm feeling like a moron So, I've been quarantining for 10 weeks and I'm fatigued. I can't take this anymore and the pandemic in my country (not the US) does not seem to be going away any time soon. Our case count and death just reaching highs day after day and local politicians are reopening despite that, many people are no longer following quarantine procedures neither social distancing anymore, sometimes it just feels like there no pandemic anymore. This is a huge cognitive dissonance for me and it's making me frustrated and hopeless if this will ever end. I just want to be able to see my friends again safely, yet I can see assholes throwing parties and all. 

Disclaimer: this post might be against some rules, since it might put my country policies towards the pandemic into question, but without this context I wouldn't feel like I was telling the whole story if I didn't mention politics there.

3991,"New normal for college? I don’t want social distancing and mask-wearing to last forever. I’m a 17 year old, and I’m going off to college next year (as of now). A couple months ago before all this started, I wanted to use college as an opportunity to change myself for the better: be more outgoing, try out new activities, and be more well-rounded. Now, I’m afraid none of that might ever happen.

My college sent me an email saying that we will most likely have a fall semester — with a lot of restrictions. All group activities are pretty much canceled, there’s social distancing, and I have to wear a mask. People are saying that this is our “new normal”.

Does this mean life will continue to be this way from now on? I understand that for this moment, this is what we have to do. But if I’m going to have to wear a mask every time I go somewhere for the rest of my life, or if shaking hands, hugging, and parties are all novelties of the past, then I don’t know if I can take it. Sorry if I sound selfish or whiny. I was so looking forward to college, and all of these changes are occurring too fast.",11,0.87,gs93cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19_support/comments/gs93cp/new_normal_for_college_i_dont_want_social/,17,Support,2020-05-29,-2,57,-0.03508771929824561
